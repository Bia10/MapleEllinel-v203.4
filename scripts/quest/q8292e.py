sm.sendNext("Wear the hat proudly, and show off your Maplemas Spirit! Now you can bring me presents in batches #b30, 40, 60, or 90#k! Like I said before, you get different rewards at different tiers; and the more presents you bring at one time, the better the rewards! And if you bring me #b100 presents#k, I'll give you a #bMaplemas Tree#k of your very own!")
sm.sendSay("In addition, let's show O-Pongo the spirit of some friendly competition as well! For each #b10 presents#k you collect for me, I'll reward you with #b1 Star of Maplemas Spirit#k, in addition to your regular reward. So if you redeem 60 presents, you'll get your reward plus #b6 Stars of Maplemas Spirit#k! The more presents you return, the more Maplemas Spirit we'll create in this world.")
sm.sendSayOkay("I'll make you a promise: if we create more #bMaplemas Spirit#k than #dVersalmas Cheer#k this year, I'll reward every player who has chosen Maplemas with #ba special reward#k at the event end! So gather as many of those presents for me, and hold on to those #bStars#k! Remember, I'm only giving this special reward if we create enough #bMaplemas Spirit#k so work hard!")
