sm.sendSayOkay("And not to worry, I understand that given your profession, you may have a preference in weapon form and fighting style. I have devised a machine that can mold the Materia into any form...be it blade, claw, staff or bow. Once you return with my required materials, we can make it into the form you wish. I bid you luck on your search... I am eager to perfect my designs!")
