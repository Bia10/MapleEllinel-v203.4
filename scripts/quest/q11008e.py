sm.sendNext("There are three types of matches in Battle Mode, but the basics are all the same. Defeat the enemy! That's all you really need to know. The only real difference is who you're fighting, and how many enemies you have.")
sm.sendSay("Number 1! #bFree-for-all#k is simple. Beat up everyone else! If you want to win, hit anything that moves. Easy, right?")
sm.sendSay("Number 2! #bTeam Match#k is a match between two teams. The eternal struggle of red against blue! Just...don't forget which team you're on, okay?")
sm.sendSay("Finally, number 3! #bIce Knight#k is a bit different. Ten people enter, and...one of them gets transformed into an Ice Knight! Yikes! Then the Ice Knight has to fight the other 9, all at once! Just thinking about it gives me chills!\r\n")
sm.sendSayOkay("And that's all! I don't want to bore you. You're already here, so why not give Battle Mode a shot? Go for it! Talk to #b#p9070000##k, and prove your skills to the world!")
