sm.sendNext("Alright, let's see... Hmmm... Just as I thought. Were you aware of this? #bDrumming Bunnies#k were supposed to be the adorable party-starters at the festival in Ludibrium. They were the ones that made the festival fun.")
sm.sendSay("And then, one by one, they started turning into monsters. I had a hunch that this crystal has something to do with it, and I'm afraid I'm right on this. It's not enough, though. I'll need to study this from different angles, so I can find out exactly what happened in the first place.")
sm.sendSayOkay("Anyway, I can't thank you enough for your hard work here, but the crime hasn't been solved, yet. We were able to find an important clue towards solving the crime, but we haven't solved it yet. I'll try to figure it out, but I am pretty sure I may need your help down the road. Please drop by whenever you have time. I'll see you around.")
