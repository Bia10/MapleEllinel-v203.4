sm.sendNext("You should be able to obtain Secret Maps by hunting Stirges and Jr. Wraiths. I had a bunch of them planted in those creatures a long time ago. When you collect 20 of them, they will form a map that indicates a fake location of our hideout. Collect the 20 Secret Maps and bring them to that foolish Job Instructor. ")
sm.sendSayOkay("Don't worry, that map is fake, it leads to some mountainous area near Perion. But that stupid Job Instructor will think otherwise. Quite a plan, no? Collect #b20 Secret Maps#k and bring them to the Job Instructor. I suggest you head over to the Kerning City Subway Line 1, as the place is crawling with #rStirges#k and #rJr. Wraiths#k.")
