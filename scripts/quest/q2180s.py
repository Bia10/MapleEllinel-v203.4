sm.sendNext("Yes yes, I like your attitude. I need to make food for everyone on board, and I am out of milk. Please fill this bottle up with milk.")
sm.sendSay("For fresh ingredients, I raise a number of milk cows at the corner of this ship. Go there, and milk some from the cows. Lately, we've seen a number of baby cows being born, and those kids sure can eat, so please be careful. If you leave the bottle in front of them, they'll just drink it all...")
sm.sendSayOkay("Oh, and you can only fill up 1/3 of this bottle from one cow. If you try to milk more, there won't be any left for the babies, so... once you're ready to hit the stable, let me know. I'll take you there.")
