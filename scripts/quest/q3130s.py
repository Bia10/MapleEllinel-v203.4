sm.sendNext("It was towards the end of the Battle at Ice Ravine. We had Rex pushed back and were taking a small break. I was on guard while the others slept when a group of Hoblins attacked! I saw one of them heading towards Pedro. Since I was too far way, I threw a dagger at the Hoblin. That dagger had been passed down to me by my teacher.")
sm.sendSayOkay("The Hoblin fell down the Ravine and my #bDagger#k was lost. I have no regrets, since I was able to save the life of a friend. Still, I would like to get the Dagger back if I can. If you get a chance, can you look for it? It's possible that one of the Hoblins may have picked it up and is using it.  ")
