sm.sendNext("It's not a difficult task actually. So many creatures have plucked the Peaches from the farm, and as a result, the Peach Tree isn't growing like it's supposed to. That's why I've decided to give the tree a 'supplement', and I want you to get #b#t4031554##k for me and for the trees.")
sm.sendSayOkay("I have to warn you, though, PLEASE don't ask #p2091002# for this. #p2091002# is the best pharmacist here in #m250000000#, but is also the owner of the Peach Farm. He will not be pleased if he hears that I plan on giving the Peach Tree some boost. That's why, although I can't completely trust him, please ask #b#p2090004##k for the medicine. Thank you!")
