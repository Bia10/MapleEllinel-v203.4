sm.sendNext("Great choice! Now, I'll explain it to you what you're going to do. Lately the aliens have been applying substantial damage to our army through lethal dose of poison, and we still haven't found a way to cure that. Fortunately, we've figured out the main reason behind the poisonous attack.")
sm.sendSay("The alien that applies the poisonous attack is a monster called #b#o4230119##k, and their tentacle seems be generate a powerful poison. We used to think the tentacle is used to feel out the situation, but I think they are also creating a lethal dose of poison to fight us.")
sm.sendSayOkay("I think I should be able to make a high quality antidote if I ferment the poison in their tentacles. For that, I need 50 of their #b#t4000120##k parts for the research. Ah, and I'll be sure to put in a request for a patent so you DEFINITELY CANNOT TELL #b#p2051000##k in the Silo about this!")
