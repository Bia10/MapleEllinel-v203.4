sm.sendNext("Long ago, after the Black Magician disappeared from Ossyria, a group of alchemists got together and formed #m261000000#. The motto of the town is 'Ultimate knowledge is only an experiment away.'")
sm.sendSay("The town itself is flush with money, since various results from experiments conducted with alchemy have been sold for lots of money. Even with all that, however, the town seems very isolated from the world. That's because alchemists in general are very introverted, which makes brokers like me much richer. Especially in times like this, where the town is in conflict...")
sm.sendSay("#m261000000# is currently split into two: #bZenumist#k and #bAlcadno#k. Zenumists are the ones considered pure alchemists that have successfully blended science and magic. Alcadnos are the ones that have added mechanical engineering to the already potent mix. They truly dislike one another, so if you want to get involved, you may want to think twice before going in.")
sm.sendSay("Because of the current conflict, the already-insulated alchemists have withdrawn even further. I honestly think a traveler like you won't get anything substantial out of #m261000000#... it's much easier for you to do anything if you're affiliated with one or the other.")
sm.sendSayOkay("That's it for basic info. Too little, you say? That's why it's BASIC info. If you want more, then come see me. I guarantee that if you want to do anything at #m261000000#, then you'll have to come back and see me sooner or later.")
