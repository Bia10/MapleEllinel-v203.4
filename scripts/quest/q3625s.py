sm.sendSayOkay("My stepmother told me this morning that she wanted some steamed shrimp, but I had so much work to do at home and I totally forgot about it. I went out later at night for some grocery shopping, but the merchants have all called it a day by then. I'll really appreciate it if you can get me #b5 #t4000166#s#k before dinner time, so I can prepare it for my stepmother. I'll give you another copy of the storybook then.")
