sm.sendNext("My wife has been a big fan of shrimp for a long time, and I think she'll like it a lot if I catch a whole lot of shrimp today and bring her #t4000166#. The problem is, I can't catch shrimp up here; they only reside at the bottom of the ocean, and a deeper one than this one.")
sm.sendSayOkay("I would appreciate it if you can gather up #b20 #t4000166#s#k for me and give them to my wife, who's at the Korean Folk Town. Of course, you'll have to tell her it's from me, okay? She should be at the Folk Town; look for #bGrandma Yeon#k.")
