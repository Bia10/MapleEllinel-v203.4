sm.sendNext("The spell that allows me to observe the current events taking place from afar is not only difficult to perform, but it's even more difficult to gather up the necessary items for the spell. It's such a difficult spell that unless I have the absolute correct list of items, the chance of failure will be high. Since you have shown the desire to find out about Gail, now it's up to you to gather up the items.")
sm.sendSay("This spell requires three important items. \r\nFirst, I need #b3 #t4031256#s#k, which is an item dropped by #r#o8140600##k, the underwater ghost. Second, I need #b10 #t4031251##k. #b#t4031251##k is very small, and they float around the water, so they'll be hard to find, but they can also be found inside the old chests that are sunken to the bottom of the ocean.")
sm.sendSay("Lastly I want #b1 #t4031253##k. This is a sound that this gigantic fish that lives inside the underwater cave makes as it perishes. It'll be difficult for you to locate the fish, let alone killing it. I wonder if you're capable of getting me this last item...")
sm.sendSayOkay("Anyway, gather up all the items I am asking you to get, so you can find out what you've wanted to find out.")
