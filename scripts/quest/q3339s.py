I didn't think there was much to investigate, anyway, but... the thing is, inside #p2111002#'s home, if you place the handle in a certain direction, you'll be able to enter the #bunderground study#k. It's a place only #p2111002# and I know of.")

sm.sendSayOkay("But who knows... I want you to look through the study. Play around with the pipe, and if you hit the spot, it'll ask you to enter the password. The password is... #bmy love Phyllia#k. Hey, don't look at me like that... it's embarrassing. Please let me know if you find a clue on this.")
