sm.sendSayOkay("Wonderful. Name's Jack. Jack Masque. I'm from Amoria, but that's neither here nor there...it's a long story why I left...but since you're still here, I'll give you the short version. I'm in love! I am lost in the throes of passion with the most beautiful creature I have laid eyes upon...a Princess. Princess Restless to be exact. I'm competing for her with some snob-nosed prince. We were out on our first date, and the time was perfect. The sun was shining, birds were tweeting, and just as I was about to receive a kiss from her sweet lips, this strange spider attacked us! I fought the beast off, but that was a one in a million chance with her! I swore to wear this mask in shame until I could return to Amoria with honor. But I must hurry, that accursed Prince Vince is sure to attempt to steal her away...So, I want you to go and eliminate 100 #o9400545#s, which should ensure that this never happens again. If you're successful, I have a particularly rare crystal that may suit you...get going!")
