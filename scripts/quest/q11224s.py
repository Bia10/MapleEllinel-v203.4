sm.sendSay("However, this method has not been scientifically verified, so I cannot suggest it to the stars yet. But that's where you come in,  #b#h0##k. This is a #rCalorie Counter#k. When you hunt monsters, this measures how many calories you burn. I've set it to measure a full workout, so bring it back when the gauge is full. Based on how long it takes you, I can figure out if this is a good exercise method or not.")
sm.sendSayOkay("The types of monsters you fight don't matter, but their level does. For you, #b#h0##k, I think you need to #rbattle Level 71 - 90 monsters#k. I think about #b200 monsters#k should do it. Remember, once this gauge is full, bring the counter back to me!")
