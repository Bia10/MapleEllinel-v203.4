sm.sendNext("Then I'll open the dimension. Get me a miniature Pianus. That's the key to open the dimension. Open the dimension, and get 40 Pieces of Courage. Ah, once you have a miniature Pianus, you can open the dimension with it, however every time you want to enter the dimension, you will need a miniature Pianus. Sadly, the miniature version only works once per trip for 5 minutes. But that's only for 5 minutes, which means you can go in there with as many friends as possible, but only for 5 minutes per trip.")
