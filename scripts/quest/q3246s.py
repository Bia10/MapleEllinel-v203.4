sm.sendNext("A while back, our king of #m220000000# received a #bstrange, anonymous note#k. Only he knows exactly what's written on it, but I think it's a note that signals the arrival of a #bnew force#k to be reckoned with. The king announced to us that we'll become their allies.")
sm.sendSay("That being said, I still can't shake this feeling of concern. I want to know exactly who wants what, and honestly, I have no clue. All I know is that their arrival will signal a new, earth-shattering change in the Maple World. What else have they brought with them?")
sm.sendSayOkay("The king told us not to worry, but I think it'll be better for us to investigate on our own. I would like for you to head to Victoria Island and go up to the #bEast forest of #m100000000##k and see what's really going on there. Thanks in advance!")
