sm.sendNext("Yes, what I witnessed through my thick lens made me think twice. It was Iruvata, a monster whose speed was incredibly fast. My burgeoning interest in the creature led me to conduct in-depth research.\r\n")
sm.sendSay("How is Iruvata capable of such speed? That was the question I sought to answer. I would spend countless long nights researching until one night, when I finally discovered something amazing... The speed and strength of Iruvata are derived from its android gears!\r\n")
sm.sendSay("I don't know which programmer invented it, but it was really something else! I didn't stop there, though. I continued my research to determine whether anyone can move as fast as an android, only to realize that...\r\n")
sm.sendSay("I had discovered a way to build a memory chip that can replicate the android gear! And I'm not going to stop now. I'm thinking about conducting more research.\r\n")
sm.sendSayOkay("If you want to make android gears, you should talk to T-1337, who isn't too far from here. I'll email him and let him know that you'll be coming to see him.\r\n")
