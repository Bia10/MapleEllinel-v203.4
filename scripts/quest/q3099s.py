sm.sendNext("Thank you very much. When I was young, I researched about Goddess Minerva but could not find any evidence and thus suffered disregard by others. This is because no traces are left although it is said that Goddess Minerva built the tall goddess tower in the area near Orbis.")
sm.sendSayOkay("However, the tower discovered within the clouds is obviously the tower of Goddess Minerva Traveler. As you venture to the tower of Goddess, look for the record that Goddess Minerva left behind. It is said that Goddess Minerva liked to write in her diary just like humans, so if her diary can be found, it will be enough data to prove my research.")
