sm.sendSayOkay("I've given you a #b#t4031761##k. Take that to the boy Spindle in this town. He's a genius with all matters mechanical, and is helping the fine soldiers there combat the alien threat. In return for the weapons I provide them for defense, Spindle has agreed to help me with my work. He's strictly a tech guy, but I've created a machine for him to help me with the magical aspects of my crafting. Spindle will be able to use my machine to form this into the weapon of your choice. You have my thanks - and should you find more #b#t4031760##k, please return it to me and I can make you another Orb. I can always use another opportunity to perfect my designs!")
