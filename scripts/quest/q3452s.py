sm.sendNext("The physical structure of the aliens are well-known in Omega Sector, so I know a thing or two about, but they can't be necessarily called #o3230302#. That's why I want you to go get #b1 #t4000099##k, which is based on #o3230302#. Once you get that, we can determine the similarities between the Blocktopus and the Omega Sector aliens.")
sm.sendSayOkay("But you know... there's gotta be a better method to research something like #t4000099#. Something like a #bManual#k... but it's really hard to get, so just disregard what I just said.")
