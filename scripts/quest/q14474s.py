sm.sendNext("Listen up. Our goal is to have a festival that everyone can enjoy. When we get the energy of Maple World's people up high enough, we can shoot off fireworks and do other fun stuff at the festival spot.")
sm.sendSay("Of course, everyone working the festival will be trying to make that happen, but it'll happen even faster if everyone pitches in when they can.")
sm.sendSay("Now, here's how you can help.\r\n1. Hunt monsters as you usually do and collect #bFestival Maple Leaves#k, and bring them to #b#p9000291##k. It'll help us kick off the festival, and we'll give you a gift, too.\r\n2. I'll teach you about this #b10th Anniversary Sharing Spirit#k buff in a moment. Use that on other people in Maple World to spread the festive energy even faster!")
sm.sendSay("For status updates on the festival, #btalk to me#k or #bclick the notifier on the left#k. At the festival spot, you can just check the #bgauge at the top-center of the screen#k.")
sm.sendSayOkay("That's all for now. If you find any #bFestival Maple Leaves#k, do bring them my way. Okay, ready to hear about the #b10th Anniversary Sharing Spirit buff#k?")
