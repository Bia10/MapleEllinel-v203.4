sm.sendNext("Cool! What I am going to ask from you is simple. Ludibrium is a floating castle supported by two huge towers, so to get down to the ground level, you'll need to go through Eos Tower, a tower of mind-numbing heights.")
sm.sendSay("It's a very important tower, but the cleaning hasn't been done lately, and the tower is now infiltrated with filthy monsters. I can't move from my duties here as a guard, so I was hoping if you can go in the tower and take care of some monsters.")
sm.sendSayOkay("A #r#o3110102##k is a large mouse-like creature with a wind-up key on its back. They've been taking over Eos Tower. Thin them out by taking care of #r50#k of them. You can find them between #b#m221022900##k and #b#m221023200##k.")
