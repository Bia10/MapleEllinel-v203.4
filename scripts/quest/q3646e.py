sm.sendNext("The Old Fox tends to collect human souls. Why? It's said that an Old Fox can become human after collecting 1000 human souls. Not sure if it is true, myself! Old Foxes do, though.")
sm.sendSay("You want to know how humans with their soul stolen become? Well... they become soulless dolls! They cannot be cured! It isn't an illness, and they are missing their souls. Of course...")
sm.sendSayOkay("Get #rone of the nine tails of an Old Fox#k and try tickling the nose of the victim with it. The soul will come back after the victim sniffles! However, you'll have to defeat an Old Fox first, and I know for sure that it won't be easy! I've done my part of the bargain of buckwheat jelly, haven't I?")
