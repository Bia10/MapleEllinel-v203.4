sm.sendSay("What am I planning for? I'm afraid I can't tell you that... anyway, in order to successfully complete a ritual, I'll need #b#t4031218##k. Have you ever heard of it?")
sm.sendSay("Heh, I don't think it really exists... I've researched it for a very long time, to find any leads on that legendary item... However, the only thing I know is that Alcaster knows something about #b#t4031218##k..")
sm.sendSayOkay("Bring me #b#t4031218##k from Alcaster... I will give you a great many rewards...")
