sm.sendNext("Very trustworthy. Hahaha... Okay, now I'll teach you how to draw those Goblins out. The #bYellow King Goblin#k is a Goblin that gets easily frightened like a chicken. It's the Goblin that once was so scared by the cracking sound of a hazelnut bite that it ran without picking up its own bat. Now, this Goblin is a big fan of pork, so if you head over to the abandoned house and place roasted pork on a stack of rocks near the house, it'll show up for sure.")
sm.sendSay("Next up is the #bBlue King Goblin#k, who is prone to forgetting things here and there. This Goblin manages to lose things quite frequently, once even losing the Goblin Hat. Some petty thief picked it up and tried stealing other things, until he got caught by the people and got heavily punished for it. This Goblin prefers #bRice Wine#k. There's a #bStone Lantern#k around the abandoned house; pour the Rice Wine in it, and it'll surely come out of the house.")
sm.sendSay("Last, but not least, the #bGreen King Goblin#k likes to engage in some Korean Wrestling. There are times in the middle of the night where it'd pop out in front of an unsuspecting soul in the middle of the night, and engage in Korean Wrestling, wearing the person out in the process. This Goblin is very fond of #bbuckwheat paste#k, and if you place it inside the #btree hole#k at a tree near the abandoned house, it'll surely appear.")
sm.sendSayOkay("Your task is to defeat all 3 King Goblins and bring back the items that they'll drop: Goblin bat, Goblin hat, and the Goblin cape. This may be too hard for you to handle alone, so I suggest you team up with a couple of your friends.")
