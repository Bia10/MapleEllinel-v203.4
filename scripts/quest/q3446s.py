sm.sendNext("Arrggh, I really don't know what to do. It is true that I am constantly hungry, and it is doubly true that I enjoy eating, but... it is inexcusable for someone to keep stealing my stuff while I am eating!")
sm.sendSay("It should be one of these guys... I am sure it's not done by the weaker ones.")
sm.sendSay("The Soul Collector I use is chock full of evil spirits, you know! If someone keeps stealing that very important item of mine... I'm very sure someone is being told to take it away from me.")
sm.sendSay("Seriously... the one I'm the most suspicious of is the one that keeps moving around me while I'm eating, the monster that moves around on a boat... the Spirit Viking...")
sm.sendSayOkay("Can you get rid of 80 Vikings and get my Soul Collectors back? It looks like this, #i4031193#, so grab the right one!")
