sm.sendSayOkay("I remember waking up in a different place...and a being of light spoke to me. It called itself #b'Subani'#k and offered me a chance to help stop the coming reign of terror. #bSubani#k told me that a mystic anchor was needed to bring a fabled lost continent back from the realm of #bVersal#k, a world which could not be helped, as the being was too powerful. The one condition was that I could never leave the continent. Ever. I agreed without hesitation.")
