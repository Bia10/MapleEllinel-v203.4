sm.sendNext("Did you get a chance to speak to O-Pongo and have him tell you the tale of Versalmas? If not, you should listen to it.")
sm.sendSay("What does the Versalmas tale mean, you ask? The tale emphasizes strength in times of hardship, and the perseverance to do the right thing, even if all seems lost... and that you will always find others like yourself if you are focused on your goal. There is a saying in this world, 'Coal turns to diamond under pressure.' Never facing the pressure means you may never discover your inner nature. This is part of the spirit of Versalmas.")
sm.sendSayOkay("Happy Versalmas, again. And may your days be bright.")
