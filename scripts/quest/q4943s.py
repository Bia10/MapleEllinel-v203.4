sm.sendNext("As I mentioned, this home belongs to Jonas Prendergast, the premier toy maker in Masteria, and perhaps all of the Maple World! Master Prendergast makes all of his wonderful toys right here, in his Workshop at the top of this house. You have heard of the Prendergast Toy Company, haven't you? No?!")
sm.sendSay("<Sigh> It is as I feared. I should say, Master Prendergast was once the premier toy maker, but as you can see, this place, and his reputation, has recently fallen into a bit of disrepair. Master Prendergast once made the most wondrous toys, his delightful creations were beloved by all children! His products made him rich, many times over, affording him this lavish home, and that drew the attention of many females. Jonas has been married several times over - seven wives in all, in fact. ")
sm.sendSay("However, Jonas had but a fleeting passion toward all of his wives- even this latest one. But the only female who held his attention was his daughter, Sophilia.")
sm.sendSay("Ah, Sophilia. Such a happy, darling child. Then came that tragic day, a day which will be scarred forever in my memory... A terrible, dark day. <Wipes away a tear> Since that day, this house has grown so cold, so cold...")
sm.sendSayOkay("Enough of my prattling... We must all carry on, so back to the task at hand! The groundskeeper, who used to chop and gather the firewood for the house, was one of our recent casualties... We have no more, and it will take much to fill all the fireplaces of this manse. If you can help me by bringing me #b60 #t4000018##k, it would get Ludmilla off my back, at least for the moment. Ludmilla is Master Prendergast's current wife, the current lady of the house. She has been complaining about the chill. Do hurry with the wood, Ludmilla can be quite the merciless nag!")
