sm.sendSayOkay("Great, let's get started! We need to find out what the current carbon dioxide level is in the air. I don't actually know what carbon dioxide is, but someone told me it smells bad, so it MUST be what's causing the air pollution! Anyway, I gave you a Carbon Dioxide Detector to measure how much of it is in the air.\n\n#bStay logged in for 30 minutes with the Carbon Dioxide Detector in your Set-up inventory tab#k to get a good reading. Once the red light on it starts blinking, bring the detector back to me by clicking on the Event Notifier on the left side of the screen. That should do it! Good luck.")
