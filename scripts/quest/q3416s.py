sm.sendNext("Nice! Thanks! I would really like to get a hold of a powerful clock that lasts for a long time. In order to make that clock, I'll need the following materials: #b2 Special Batteries, 10 #t4000115#s, and 10 #t4000114#s#k. With these, I feel like I can make the ultimate alarm clock!")
sm.sendSayOkay("You can find all of them at the Ludibrium Clocktower. #b#t4031115##k can be found through a robot-looking monster, #b#t4000115##k through Chronos, and #b#t4000114##k through Tick-Tocks. I'll be here waiting for good news. Good luck!")
