sm.sendNext("As I'm sure you already know, #m310000000# is under the rule of the Black Wings. The evil Black Wings, in their attempt to resurrect the Black Mage, have occupied an innocent city and are robbing them of both their resources and their freedom. ")
sm.sendSay("The residents of #m310000000# fought back fiercely. When we found out about their Resistance, we decided to join forces with them. We were united by a common enemy.")
sm.sendSay("Time passed and the people of #m310000000# prepared for battle. They devised a plan to defeat the Black Wings and regain their freedom once and for all. We swore to help them. On the day of the battle, the #p110100# knights were to send support troops.")
sm.sendSay("But of all days, on THAT day... No, don't ask anymore. Something happened, which we didn't expect, something we were powerless against. We weren't able to help the people of #m310000000#. We were barely able to defend ourselves.")
sm.sendSay("In the end, we barely managed to protect Ereve and the Empress, but #m310000000# was a complete disaster. The Black Wings came down upon them hard, all because we weren't there to help them...")
sm.sendSay("So you see, their anger is justified. We must accept their condemnation. You are responsible. Yes, you. Though you weren't directly responsible, you are a #p1101000# Knight, so you must shoulder part of the blame.")
sm.sendSayOkay("As the Empress has said, if there is anything you can do for them, please do it. They have sworn to have nothing to do with anything that bears the name of the Empress so... there is very little we as an organization can do.")
