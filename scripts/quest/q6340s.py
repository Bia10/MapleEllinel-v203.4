sm.sendNext("When you use Super Transformation, it is imperative that you have a stone-cold demeanor. That means you should use this without any mood swings or thoughts into it. It looks like you still have a soft spot in your heart, so... head over to Leafre, and you'll encounter a monster named Red Dragon Turtle. Its heart is made out of stone, and it is both ruthless and cold-blooded. Now, I am not saying you should emulate them, but I do want you to take note. Yes, you will be facing the Red Dragon Turtle.")
sm.sendSayOkay("If the training ends well, then I'll even give you a small reward. I'll teach you a skill that you can use through Super Transformation. What do you think? Now, go ahead and defeat #r150 Red Dragon Turtles#k. I also need evidence that you really did slay the Red Dragon Turtles, so I want you to bring back #b50 Hearts of Stone#k.")
