sm.sendSay("Fortunately, I found #o5120506# much later, but years of wear and tear in the forest has rendered this document old and ragged, with ripped pages here and there. This is precisely the reason why it's impossible to acquire the mysterious skills through the pages of #o5120506#. If you are really intent on learning the skill, however, you'll have to acquire #b#t4000299##k #i4000299#.")
sm.sendSayOkay("Other #o5120506#s may secretly hold on to #t4000299#, so I suggest you defeat #r#o5120506##k and bring me #b10#k pages.")
