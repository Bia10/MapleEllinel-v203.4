sm.sendNext("As you can see, our kingdom is in a cold, snowy region. Because of our location, we weren't a wealthy kingdom. Instead, we were modest... And perhaps that's why the people here had warm hearts. We didn't care about grander things.")
sm.sendSay("And that was probably why we remained calm when the rumor came that the Black Mage had appeared. Whatever the Black Mage's plan was, we figured he wouldn't attack our kingdom. The kingdom had not a single thing worth taking.")
sm.sendSay("Even when the Alliance was formed, our kingdom wanted to stay out of it. We wanted nothing to do with the Black Mage, as every single person was important to our kingdom. So, our consensus was to decline the request from the Alliance.")
sm.sendSay("However, the Alliance did not accept our response. They called us minions of the Black Mage, and attacked our kingdom. We held out as long as we could, but our kingdom was too small and weak... Our kingdom fell soon after the attacks had begun.")
sm.sendSayOkay("When the king returned after trying to negotiate with the Alliance, only the castle was left, ravaged by flames. I can't even imagine what he must have been going through. In that moment, he lost everything. Driven to despair and fury, the King decided to join the Black Mage.")
