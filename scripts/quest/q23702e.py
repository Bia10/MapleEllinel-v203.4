sm.sendNext("By now, you've heard about the missing research, I'm sure. The Zenumists and Alcadnos would each love to believe the others were at fault, but that job was not performed by amateurs. The thieves were #btrained professionals#k.")
sm.sendSay("But what you may not know is that those thieves failed at first. The documents were protected by a very #bsecretive enchantment#k that the underlings were unable to crack. #bThat's why they called in their boss#k.")
sm.sendSay("The boss arrived, and the documents were gone. It's quite clear to any level-headed person that neither the Zenumists nor the Alcadno had anything to do with the robbery.")
sm.sendSay("Yet both sides insist it was the other, because who else could have broken such a powerful enchantment?")
sm.sendSay("The culprit must have been skilled, and definitely came from outside. Even I, the repository of information, could not find a way to break that spell.")
sm.sendSay("Interestingly enough, the #bboss#k met up with #bBedin#k, one of the Zenumists. I would recommend you pay him a visit in #b#m261010000##k.")
sm.sendSayOkay("That's all the talking you've paid me for. Our business is at an end.")
