sm.sendNext("There was once a kingdom called #bSharenian#k in the northern reaches of Maple World. The king of Sharenian, Sharen II, was known for his wisdom, but in his pride he made a terrible mistake. You see, Sharen II possessed a magnificent jewel, the Rubian. Fearing its loss, he summoned the most powerful creature he could to guard it. This was the demon #rErgoth#k. True to his nature, Ergoth broke his promise and destroyed the kingdom.")
sm.sendSay("It is said the kingdom of Sharenian itself now lies deep beneath the surface of the world.\n\nThose who survived the disaster chose to create an order of #bKnights#k to prevent such an event in the future. They chose children with pure hearts and a special ability for this order. ")
sm.sendSay("Over time, the order grew and prospered on the site of the lost Sharenian kingdom, and became known as the #bKnights of Virtue#k. Their special ability is to draw out the dark powers of monsters and seal them in special stones. They brought peace to their land and much of Maple World, and when they were no longer needed, they sealed their powers away in the High Stone of Virtue at the center of Maple World.")
sm.sendSay("However, just a few days ago, the unthinkable happened. The High Stone of Virtue exploded, scattering Virtue Fragments all over the world. We sought the reason for this and discovered that it was caused by the return of Ergoth himself! He now threatens all of Maple World, so we need the Knights of Virtue once again. That's why I am now asking you, #b#h0##k, to join the new #bKnights of Virtue#k and save Maple World!")
sm.sendSayOkay("You've got your #rStone of Virtue#k, right? When you #bhunt monsters in specific places with the Stone of Virtue#k, their dark energy will be absorbed by the Stone. When it is full, you can unleash and control those powers as if they were your own. #rClick the purple Knights of Virtue icon at the left of your screen to locate the hunting grounds#k. Good luck!")
