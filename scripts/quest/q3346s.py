I'm saying that all alchemy-related studies in #m261000000# are... based on the studies of the Black Magician.")
sm.sendSay("Of course, that doesn't mean they are working on evil spells like the Black Magician. They were just referencing the Black Magician's work purely from an academic standpoint. Even with that, after a while, almost all remnants of the Black Magician disappeared.")
sm.sendSay("Even with all that, it doesn't change the fact that #m261000000# is based on Black Magician. You may not be aware of it, since it hasn't been too long since you first got to Ossyria, but... Ossyria still has a number of forces that oppose the Black Magician.")

The reputation of #m261000000#, a respected alchemist town that heavily affects Ossyria as a whole with their contributions, will go down the drain. That's why the presidents of the Societies in #m261000000# have been adamant about keeping all this quiet.")
sm.sendSayOkay("But nowadays, I am not sure if this should be kept secret any longer. Look at #p2111002#, a bright alchemist with a great future. His only sin was dedicating his whole life to the studies and researches... and when he became too close to the truth, he became a martyr instead. The truth must be told... to make sure his name emerges clean and free of rumors and scandals, if nothing else...")
