sm.sendNext("Okay, so you still want to know what it is, right? I'll tell you of a great way to get to Omega Sector at once. Tada! This card is all you need to make a quick trip there! I carried out Muirhat's order once and he gave me this as a reward. Use this card, and you'll have access to the warp portal that heads to Omega Sector. How is there a portal like that, you ask?")
sm.sendSay("Dr. Kim of Omega Sector has been lifelong friends with Kyrin. They both share a mutual interest in technology, and they help each other out. When Kyrin built The Nautilus, I heard that Dr. Kim helped out quite a bit. They still look to one another for technological help, and that's why they built this warp portal.")
sm.sendSay("If you do me a favor, then I'll give you this card. Your basic trade of the goods, you know. What do you think? I have a list of items that I have to deliver to multiple places, and... if you can do it for me, I'll give you this Warp Card.")
sm.sendSayOkay("Wait, hold on. I need to organize this list. I need to see Shulynch, Muirhat, and Black Bark... hmmm... talk to me in a bit, okay?")
