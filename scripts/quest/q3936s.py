sm.sendNext("Every member of the Sand Bandits has a deep hatred towards the queen. We just don't show it publicly. You can't achieve anything if you don't even have self control.")

sm.sendSayOkay("You know of Lidium. It's a jewel you can find by slaying monsters in the desert. If you bring me #b2 #t4011008#s#k, then I'll personally accept you as a member of the Sand Bandits. It's not easy refining small ores into jewels, so... I think this will be a good test to gauge your patience.")
