sm.sendNext("Unbeknownst to most everyone, there's a #bSecret Passage#k that connects Zenumist and Alcadno. It's a secret passage that almost no one knows of. Even if you are aware of it, it's off limits. You need a #bpass#k to have access to the passage.")
sm.sendSay("But about that pass... I can't remember where I misplaced it. I don't even remember when I lost it, either. If I had that, then I would have used that passage regularly. Maybe the #r#o6110301#s#k took it...")
sm.sendSayOkay("If you, for some reason, end up with the pass, then try using it at the entrance of the passage at either #m261010000# or #m261020200#. That should be enough to gain access to the secret passage.")
