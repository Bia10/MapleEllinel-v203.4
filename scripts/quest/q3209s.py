sm.sendNext("Thank you. I am sure you're terribly busy but still. Well, here's a problem. It has happened before, but it has happened much more often lately. Every time I make food, it disappears. I am sure it's the rats, but I can't prove it.")
sm.sendSay("I work hard at making the best food possible, and as soon as I leave, even for a few minutes, the food just disappears. It's so disheartening. The thing is... this has happened before, and because of that, I got some #o3110102#s as a toy rat, and I set up rat traps on them to catch rats.")
sm.sendSayOkay("But they've turned into monsters now, as you can see, and it's my fault. Can you go defeat the #rRatz#k between #b#m221023200##k and the Eos Tower 97th Floor and gather #b45 #t4000095#s#k?")
