sm.sendSayOkay("Fabulous! My name's Jacob and I run the Sakura Garden. I'm looking to expand the garden with some more trees and nice, leather sofas. However, I'm rather lacking in the materials department. A well-traveled being such as you should have no problem gathering #b25 Cherry Blossom Seeds#k, #b10 Silk Feathers#k and #b10 Leather#k. The Cherry Blossom Seeds come from Sakura Cellions. I recall seeing a few over in the Purple Plains area of Amoria, so you may want to check over there. The Silk Feathers are fairly rare, but I've heard through the grapevine that Jr. Lioners tend to shed them upon demise. Bring them back to me, and I'll give you some of my very best potions stock!")
