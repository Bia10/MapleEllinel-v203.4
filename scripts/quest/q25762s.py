sm.sendNext("Good. If you indeed call yourself Kaiser, you must act the part. Your task will be to gather allies to aid us. While Magnus may be a conquerable foe, Darmoor may very well not be.")
sm.sendSay("We have decided to look far and wide for new allies, and you will be traveling farther than anyone before. You know about the Interdimensional Portal at Pantheon, yes? This is one of the doorways to other worlds left when Darmoor sealed Chronica, the Transcendent of Time. We sealed the portal then, as we did not know where it led.")
sm.sendSay("But now, we think the risk is worth taking. We have decided to send you through the portal to find new allies. However, it cannot be denied that you are far weaker than the previous Kaiser. We expect you to hone your skills as you explore the new world we send you to.")
sm.sendSayOkay("You and the Angelic Buster will take the portal and proceed with the mission. However, we must break the seal first. I have already ordered #p3000001# to work on this. You are to go see #p3000001# immediately.")
