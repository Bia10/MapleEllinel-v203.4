sm.sendSayOkay("First I'll need #b1 #t4140100##k. You have it with you, right? Then, in order to wrap it up in two layers, I'll need #b1 #t4031110##k and #b1 #t4031109##k. Of course, with the enhanced power of love on the chocolate, the packaging will also have to be different. You'll need to buy #b1 #t4031113##k and #b1 #t4031114##k through #bCoco#k, who's next to me.")
