sm.sendSayOkay("Great news. Well, we're schedules to get married, and I got Moony to give us a set of Golden Heart rings. Would you believe that the day after I propose, some Tweeters came along and dismantled both rings into fragments to put in their nest? Ridiculous. If you could hunt them down, I'm sure you'd come across the #b20 Ring Fragments#k. After that, Moony has agreed to restore the rings. If you could bring them back to us, we'd be grateful beyond words.")
