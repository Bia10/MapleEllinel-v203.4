sm.sendSay("That door you see over there is called the #bTime Gate#k. It's the key to traveling through time. I'm from Neo City in the year 2503. Machines have taken over our city and are attacking humans. We could not find a solution to the chaos, so I came to the past to set things right.")
sm.sendSay("I'm a time traveler. I wanted to come to the past of Neo City, but I overshot the mark. It took me awhile to realize what I had done. So, I need to travel through time again.")
