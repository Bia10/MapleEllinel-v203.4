sm.sendNext("Hmmm, alright. It's very simple actually. All you need to do right now is to hunt the monsters. And don't think a simple act like hunting won't be of much help. You'll be assigned to do a few tasks through me, and you'll ultimately end up growing as a traveler.")
sm.sendSay("You already know how to hunt monsters? No way. Impossible. You're a newbie. ")
sm.sendSay("Look around this town, and you'll run into lots of monsters. The weakest of all is the Snail, a tiny green snail, and it's a piece of cake. The next weakest are the Blue Snails and the Shrooms. My advice to you is to feast on the weaker monsters and level up easily, until it gets to the point where you can handle bigger, stronger, and faster monsters. It's all about understanding your strengths and weaknesses, and using that knowledge to hunt down the right monsters. \n\n#r5#k #o100100#s\n#r5#k #o100101#s\n#r3#k #o120100#s#k")
sm.sendSayOkay("Oh, and press W to see the World Map and locate Southperry. Go there and meet #p9201199#, and he may have something in store for you. You can take on #p9201199#'s quest while training with me, so I suggest you meet him pronto.")
