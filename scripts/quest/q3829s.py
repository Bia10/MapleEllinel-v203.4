sm.sendNext("Okay, so you must be as curious about #t4031551# as others. Now let's look at his travel log. Since I have enjoyed the beach before moving permanently to #m251000000#, this should be a piece of cake. As for #t4031551#... right inside the ship is a #bthe deck where the bellflowers are guarding#k. Apparently, that's where it is.")
sm.sendSay("Lord Pirate seems to be a hard guy to handle. Looking at this travel log, it looks like the only way the box can be open is through a key held by Lord Pirate, so I think we'll need to receive #b#t4031437##k from Lord Pirate, and investigate #bLord Pirate's lair#k. With this much info, we'll be able to find #t4031551#.")
sm.sendSayOkay("Okay, I'd like for you to one thing. If you ever get to find #t4031551#, I want you to use those treasures to help out #m251000000#. Thanks to Lord Pirate living nearby, the poor residents suffer as a result. Hopefully those treasures will aid in their path towards recovery. You promised!")
