sm.sendNext("This detector is actually not a complete product. I just brought one that was still in its beta stages. Since it had a high probability of failure, I didn't want to bring it straight to the battleground, so... i wanted to test it at #m102000000#, where there's a high probability of the puppeteer appearing.")
sm.sendSayOkay("Thankfully, the test worked to perfection. As suspected by #p1101002#, the puppeteer appeared around #m102000000#, and the detector proved it without a shadow of doubt. I was worried we might have gotten a totally different monster, but that's not the case.")
