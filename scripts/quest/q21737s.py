sm.sendSay("How in the world did a Nependeath like that come about? I have no idea. Nependeaths in #m200000000# are not the type that grow like this one. We'll need to look for the cause behind this. Can you eliminate #r#o9300347#s#k and find out the #bcause#k of all of this?")
sm.sendSayOkay("The #o9300347# population can be found in #m200060001#. Enter through the crumbled entrance on the left side of #b#m200000200##k. Eliminate some #o9300347# monsters, and bring me anything suspicious. You know what suspicious looks like, right? ")
