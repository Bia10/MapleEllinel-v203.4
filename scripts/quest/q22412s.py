sm.sendSay("The only thing is that those materials are much more difficult to handle than before so I'm going to have to charge you a higher fee. It's going to me 60000000 mesos. Your eyes are spinning from all those 0s. Simply stated, it will cost #b60 million mesos#k.")
sm.sendSay("I realize how expensive that sounds but it's an adequate price for the skill it takes to make a saddle using those materials. If the #m230000003# cost less to operate, I might be able to give you a discount, but as you can see, there are so few visitors here at the #m230000003#...")
sm.sendSay("But since you're raising an animal that must cost a fortune to feed, you must be very well off. 60 million mesos is probably nothing to you. Heck, someone like you could probably buy dozens of saddles.")
sm.sendSayOkay("I will be here waiting for you to bring all the materials.")
