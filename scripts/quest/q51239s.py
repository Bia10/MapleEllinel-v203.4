sm.sendNext("You are very brave. I will issue you OSSS Mission 5.")
sm.sendSay("As I've already mentioned, that mothership is designed so you can teleport to other cubes once inside. That means we have access to all the alien ships still in the sky. We can take this opportunity to launch an attack.")
sm.sendSay("Please put on the #bVisitor Suit#k and enter the mothership.  Defeat all the enemies inside.\r\nOnce inside, don't take off that suit. A foreign energy will detect it and attack you if you do.\r\n Let me tell you once again, the Visitor Suit is the transformed suit upgraded from the Bing Machine-Alpha Suit.")
sm.sendSay("When you complete the mission, the OSSS will issue you a medal.\r\nPlease remember that #bonly 1 medal will be issued to you each day#k for entering the mothership.\r\nYou can enter #bthe most difficult Cube once a day, the middle difficulty Cube three times a day, and the low difficulty Cube without limit#k. ")
sm.sendSayOkay("Doctor Bing and I will be in touch with you via radio.")
