sm.sendNext("This may be a long story. I set off to travel a long way in hopes of discovering the truth behind the legends of the Monster Figures, and while traveling, I ran into a wise man who had a tribe to himself in the middle of the desert. The story behind the Guardian that wise man told me turned out to be a great clue.")
sm.sendSay("That tribe had a Guardian that protected their tribe. It may look like nothing more than a bunch of hay disguising itself as a 'figure', but it had immaculate jewelry on it's head. When the wise man placed the jewelry on its head, the previously ragged-looking 'doll' was engulfed in a mysterious beam of light, and became a powerful Guardian.")
sm.sendSay("That's when I thought of the small hole behind the Monster Figure, and hurriedly returned to town and placed a gem I picked up from the street on it. That's when the statue became engulfed by the mysterious light and emerged with mysterious power. If you give me a gem, I'll make a Monster Crystal Figure with mysterious powers surrounding it.")
sm.sendSayOkay("The gems I'll place on the back of the Statue are #b3 #t04020000##ks, #b3 #t04020001##ks, and #b3 #t04020005#s#k. Wthen you get me the gems, I'll make you the Monster Crystal Figure.")
