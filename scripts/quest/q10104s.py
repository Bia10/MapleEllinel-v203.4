sm.sendSayOkay("Okay, now out of all the dropped items from the monsters, I want you to find the #torn piece from the Book of Cygnus#k. This piece contains a mysterious power that produces some effects when it's individually placed, but when the 20 pieces come together, you'll be able to read a message from Cygnus that details her beliefs. Gather up 20 pieces, then use them in your 'use' inventory. You don't need to bring it back to me.")
