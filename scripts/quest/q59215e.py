sm.sendSay("It's a long story, but #o8860000#'s envoy came to us a while back and started telling us he was going to destroy us if we didn't cooperate!")
sm.sendSay("But I was like whaaat? Not happening. We're not getting tied up in a bunch of human nonsense, especially with a guy like that.")
sm.sendSay("That didn't stop him from taking some of our people though... So if you want to stop him, you've got my help.")
sm.sendSay("I'm not sure where he went, but I keep hearing talk about #bTest Subjects#k. His people came to ask us about subjects from space...")
sm.sendSay("That's right. #bTest subjects#k. Other than that, they were always just threatening us.")
sm.sendSayOkay("I hope this bit helps... at least a little bit.")
