sm.sendNext("With the report comes the doll, again. Does this mean the #rPuppeteer#k is the one in charge? Hmmm... ah, I suppose you haven't been filled in with details about this.")
sm.sendSay("Based on the information we have gathered over the last few months, we managed to discover that one of Black Mage's men has the ability to control monsters through dolls. We don't know the exact name, and the Knights refer to him as just a Puppeteer.")
sm.sendSayOkay("I do believe that these events that have taken place recently are closely linked to that of the Puppeteer. We do not have a concrete evidence for that as of yet, so we need to dig for more information. Well, even if you do, you won't be able to face off against the Puppeteer with the level you're at right now, so I will most likely withhold from giving you the assignment anyway. I'll see you when you reach #bLevel 18#k.")
