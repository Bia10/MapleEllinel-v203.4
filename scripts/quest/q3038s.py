sm.sendNext("Alright! Actually, I've been here studying the basis of self-moving rocks for the past 30 years. The more visible ones at this tower are the monsters that resemble a bunch of moving stones, and I'm here to study anything and everything involving them. Conducting studies on them takes time, however, and so it is almost impossible for me to gather up the samples of them.")
sm.sendSayOkay("I need you to go to the tower, take down the monsters, and collect the pieces that make up their bodies. I need #b15 #t4000083#s, 15 #t4000063#s, and 15 #t4000085#s#k. I'll be here waiting for you. Not like I have anywhere to be, after all.")
