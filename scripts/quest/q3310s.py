sm.sendNext("Then before starting this, I'd like to see what you are capable of. I'll be testing your ability to handle tough assignments. The test is simple, actually. Head off to the #bClosed Lab#k and rein in the dangerous #r#o6110300#s#k. ")
sm.sendSay("Controlling #o6110300# can be done through the Pentagram of Alchemy, which is located at the center of the closed lab. Slay the #o6110300#s that are inside, recover the #b#t4031698##k that they have stolen, and throw it in the Pentagram of Alchemy. It will then be activated, which will control #o6110300#.")
sm.sendSayOkay("As a proof that you have successfully controlled #o6110300#, bring #b#t4031709##k back after using it all. Then, and only then, will I trust you to handle the more difficult task. If you think it's going to be tough, then you can bail out from this. If you bail out, however, you won't be able to obtain crucial clues on the missing alchemist.")
