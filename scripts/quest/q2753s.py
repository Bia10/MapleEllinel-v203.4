sm.sendSay("And those humans didn't even bother to say sorry! They just ran past as if nothing happened. Stupid human jerks! ...Not you though. You're cool.")
sm.sendSayOkay("Anyway, my #bGlass Shoes#k fell off the tree, and I couldn't find them anywhere. I think the #r#o1210103#s#k might have eaten them. It will make me really happy if you could get my #bGlass Shoes#k back from the #r#o1210103#s#k. The #r#o1210103#s#k are near #b#m101020100##k.")
