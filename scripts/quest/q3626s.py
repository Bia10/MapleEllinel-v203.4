sm.sendNext("I think you've met it before. Head over to the town entrance, and Swallow should still be there. Its wings still have not been healed, and that's why it's still in town. I've been visiting it every day, helping it cure its wings. I suggest you go there today. 날개가 다 낫지 않아서 아직 마을에 머물고 있죠. 제가 매일 찾아가서 상처를 치료해주고 있는데, 오늘은 당신이 한번 가보세요.")
sm.sendSayOkay("Try talking to Swallow and bring #b10 #t4000168#s#k with you; it has the same storybook that I had, and it'll be more than willing to trade for it.")
