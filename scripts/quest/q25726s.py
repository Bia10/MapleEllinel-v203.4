sm.sendSayOkay("Don't you know? #p3000013# was cursed by the Relic. If she didn't always stick her face into things, she'd be better off. I mean, courage is great and all, but you need the power to back it up! Eh, you know that better than me, though. I still feel bad for her. I'll visit #b#m400020300##k after work.")
