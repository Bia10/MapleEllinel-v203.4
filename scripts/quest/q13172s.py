sm.sendNext("It sure is nice to see you. It makes me want to tell you of my tribe’s oldest legend. There was once a pig, the #bBravest Ribbon Pig#k. She wanted nothing more than to be human, so she did what any sane human would do... she consumed only mugwort and garlic for 3 months and 10 days in a cave. Eventually, she turned into the #bbeautiful founding chieftess#k of our tribe. ")
sm.sendSay("You’re looking so well today. Almost as well as the only medal ever found befitting of such a chieftess: the #i1142547##r#t1142547:##k. Would you like to see it? ")
sm.sendSay("Hel-looo! I can’t just give it to you. You have to prove you’re as worthy as our pig-goddess-tribal-founder. Maybe if you complete #rall six missions#k in the #bMiwok Rescue Log#k... ")
sm.sendSayOkay("Why don’t we talk more often? I almost forgot to tell you about the #i3010516##r#t3010516:# Chair#k my friends made! I just know you’ll love the amazing dance routine that comes along with it.")
