sm.sendNext("Thanks! Lately the monsters have gotten much angrier than usual, so that makes my job that much harder, as I have to constantly fix the damages they inflict. The problem is, I have been running out of materials to work with, so I haven't been able to do any fixing at this point. I am worried that one day, this tower may fall apart.")
sm.sendSayOkay("Please take apart the #r#o4230109#s#k and #r#o4230110#s#k constructs near here and bring me #b50#k of their #b#t4000101#s#k and #b50#k of their #b#t4000102#s#k. That should speed up our repair process by a whole 43 percent!")
