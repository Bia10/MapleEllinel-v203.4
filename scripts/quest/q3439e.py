sm.sendSay("If that's the case, then the majority of the dolls that have turned into monsters have been attacking humans because of that Dark Crystal, laden with the force of evil. Now that the aliens have a hold of this information, you never know what kind of sinister plans they may be thinking of. We have to hurry, because this town may be in danger!")
