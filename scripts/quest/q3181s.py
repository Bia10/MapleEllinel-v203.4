sm.sendSay("My name is #b#p2161004##k. I came here looking for the legendary #bLion King's Medal#k. I was searching the entire castle for the medal, but then everything started shaking, and monsters appeared! I tried to run, when a man appeared in front of me out of nowhere.")
sm.sendSay("That man claimed that he was #bVon Leon the Lion King#k, the king of this castle. He then turned me into a ghost to trap me here...to punish me. It must be a curse or something. I can still feel my body...and it hurts a lot! I can't move much, and it even hurts to talk like this.")
sm.sendSayOkay("I want to deliver this letter to my family. Could you take this letter to #bAlcaster#k in El Nath? Alcaster will then send it to my family.")
