Instead of finding them randomly, can you find them according to the #rorder of the ranks#k? Of course you should know which rank is low and which one is high, right? hahaha")
sm.sendSayOkay("Since they have made emergency landings all over Ossyria following through with the operation, it'll require you to search every corner of this place, be it towns, fields, etc. Please see my men from the highest rank down, and if they have something for me, please take them and give them to me in the end. I'll be waiting you then. Good luck!")
