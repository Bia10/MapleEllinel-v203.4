sm.sendNext("Seeing your Rep skyrocket to that level never ceases to surprise me, but the real fun of having a Family isn't the Rep. It's the #bEntitlement#k that only the famous explorers can enjoy! With your level of Rep, it's already available for you... ")
sm.sendSay("My last mission to you is to actually use this Entitlement. Using '/' as the center of the Family window, the left shows the current Rep, and the number on the right shows the total Rep. When using the Entitlement, only the current Rep will be used. The total Rep is more for record.")
sm.sendSayOkay("I want you to achieve a #rtotal Rep of 2,000 or above#k, and bring your #rcurrent Rep down to below 500#k. After that, you can come back to me and report the results. Make sure to check your Rep level through the Family window. Best of luck to you!")
