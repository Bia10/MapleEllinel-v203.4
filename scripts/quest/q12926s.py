sm.sendNext("The Pied Piper Cat should appear if you go to the Custodial Closet and start routing the mice out. You must also rout out the cat! But watch out for the ghosts there, each of their hits will damage you for 20% of your health. Ghosts can't look below so you can stay low to avoid getting hit.")
