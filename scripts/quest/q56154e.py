sm.sendSay("Bring me a mess of #t4001778# items at Baabaalloon Hill, and I'll blow up our lovely sheep balloon even bigger! When it pops, I'll be sad, but it'll drop TONS of gifts! The thing is, the gifts are only for the person who pops it. Well, them and #reveryone in that player's world#b. You gotta understand, I'm not made of gifts!")
