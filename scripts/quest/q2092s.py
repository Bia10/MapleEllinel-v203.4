sm.sendNext("The great news is that I have found my daughter! My assistant went to places near Perion to pick up some samples. After he got done with it, he stopped by Perion for a few, and apparently, he met a lady that eerily resembled my daughter!")
sm.sendSay("So he started talking to her, and apparently, she does not remember anything from her childhood. She's also not a tribesperson... that has got to be my daughter. It seems like she was beyond shocked when she was attacked by the mushroom monster.")
sm.sendSay("That is most likely the reason why she does not remember her childhood. Here... I want you to give her this sword for me. My daughter liked to pose as a knight while growing up.")
sm.sendSayOkay("This toy sword was something she really enjoyed playing with. This may help her bring back the memories and remember the past. Please help me help my daughter.")
