sm.sendNext("Hahaha... you definitely have your head screwed on the right place. Okay, now you'll have to go see #bLord Pirate#k. What? Why the pirate ship? Well, from what I hear, apparently there are ingredients on the pirate ship that just cannot be grown on a normal ground. They are called #b#t2022132##k and #b#t2022131##k, and supposedly those are the ingredients that contain concentrated levels of the effects of the regular herbs.")
sm.sendSay("But other potent ingredients like 100-year-old bellflowers and ginsengs are too powerful to be concentrated. They can only be concentrated by being neutralized by the ocean. Unfortunately, there's no ocean around here to find them, but the pirate ship, which has gone through ample amounts of ocean water, should be a fertile 'ground' for those ingredients.")
sm.sendSayOkay("Thus, I would like for you to enter the lair of Lord Pirate and collect #b50 #t2022132#s#k and #b100 Ginseng Concentrates#k. It's not easy to enter the lair, but I want you to put your best effort in it, since this is to create powerful medicines for people.")
