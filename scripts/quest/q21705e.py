sm.sendNext("...I can't believe it. I'm standing in front of a hero. I used to live on that island myself, and I also used to believe the prophecy, but... oh my goodness. #p1201000#'s wishes have finally come true. What? You want to know what I was just talking about?")
sm.sendSay("After discovering the Book of Prophecy, our race has been bracing for your inevitable resurrection for hundreds of years... all in that tiny island with nothing but ice... but the hero never came, and we've been slowly losing our faith in the prophecy.")
sm.sendSay("In the end, most people left #m140000000#, tired of waiting for the prophecy that never came true. I just hope you don't blame them for leaving. They had to do what they had to do, you know. But, that being said...")
sm.sendSay("#p1201000# was the one person that never lost hope, and stayed in #m140000000# long after everyone else left, holding onto the belief that the hero will someday come back and save us. Even after her #bolder brother#k left the island. That's one stubborn kid, I tell you.")
sm.sendSay("But now that you're here, that stubborness has been rewarded. Thank you for coming back. Now I can look #p1201000# in the eye again. I have felt so bad for not being of any support to her, even though we are cousins.")
sm.sendSayOkay("Just tell me what you want to do, and I'll be there to help. Not just because you're the hero in our eyes, but also because you've validated #p1201000#.")
