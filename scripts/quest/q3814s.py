sm.sendNext("But the Tornado Sea on Ossyria is way too treacherous for anyone to enter. It would be of great help if I could find someone who is very familiar with the Sea, but the only ones that really are familiar are the #rpirates of the Lord Pirate#k. Lord Pirate possesses the #t4001119# that has a path drawn on the Tornado Sea, supposedly the only path that enables the sailors to navigate through the treacherous sea. So lucky!")
sm.sendSayOkay("I hear rumors that Lord Pirate is currently located somewhere at a #btown in Ossyria#k. He apparently gave #t4001118#s to his pirates, so I suppose it's possible we can find it if we enter their lair. Hey, traveler, since you said you understood my predicament, I want you to get #b#t4001118#, 6 #i4001118##k for me. Please.")
