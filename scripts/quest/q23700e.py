sm.sendNext("I will share our secrets with you, but ONLY because #p2300004# asked me to do so. If you cross the Zenumists in any way, we will punish you accordingly, no matter what kind of friends you may have.")
sm.sendSay("This forbidden alchemy has haunted me since I discovered it long ago. I believed then that this knowledge was left behind the #bBlack Mage#k. I knew it was too dangerous for the world to know about.")
sm.sendSay("Unfortunately, it appears another group held the same beliefs. All books and scrolls regarding the research has been stolen. \r\n#bStolen?!#k")
sm.sendSay("Yes, and I don't know by who. However, the research was extremely well-hidden. It would have taken someone familiar with the inner-workings of our organization to find it.")
sm.sendSayOkay("The #bAlcadno#k scum are vehemently denying their involvement, of course, but it must be them. They have no respect for the power of alchemy. It's quite obvious, wouldn't you agree?")
