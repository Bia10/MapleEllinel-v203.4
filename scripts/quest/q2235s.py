sm.sendNext("Can you find Manji's apprentice for me? I'm tied up with Ilji here. Mu Young's probably in the deeper parts of Sleepywood Dungeon.")
sm.sendSay("Those evil red eyes... It's horrifying beyond words and you wouldn't understand it unless you've seen them yourself. Anyway, since then, I haven't been able to get that image out of my mind. I thought I was over it... but.... ")
sm.sendSay("As the sun was setting in the west, I felt the pull of an energy I hadn't felt in ages. It felt like... the Balrog. I just couldn't ignore the feeling I had in the pit of my stomach, so I sent my apprentice, #bMu Young#k, to investigate the Sleepywood dungeon.")
sm.sendSayOkay("He said he'd let me know if he found anything, but it's been a month with no word. I'm getting worried. Can you go search for Mu Young? The last time I heard from him was when he sent this message: \r\n#b'Master, I am going to get to the bottom of this, and to do so, I'm going to start from the place where it all began. I'll keep you posted!'#k")
