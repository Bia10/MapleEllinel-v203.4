sm.sendNext("Hey, do you know where in #m925020000# #p2091007# resides? He's at the very top floor of #m925020000#, awaiting the master of combat for a challenge. In other words, you'll have to get all the way up to the top floor by battling and only then will you be able to meet #p2091007#. But looking at you, you don't seem to have the skill for that yet.")
sm.sendSay("But I can't just give up my life like this! There is another way. Do you know #p2091007#'s student #b#p2091005##k? If you can convince him, you may be able to see #p2091007#. How do you convince him, you ask? Hahaha... I know all his weaknesses.")
sm.sendSayOkay("#p2091005# is so determined to get stronger that he will literally eat anything and everything that's said to be good for the body. Even things like #b#t4000293##k, so if you can sneak in a couple of those and ask to meet him, then he'll probably teach you the backdoor shortcut to the top of the building. Good luck!")
