sm.sendSayOkay(" I make pots here for the townspeople here, free of charge. Normally I do not make them for anyone outside this town, but since you have done our family a huge favor by carrying all that shrimp my husband asked you to bring, I'll gladly make a pot for you, if you wish to come back later. You may not be from this town, but I really appreciate your kindness. I'll see you around.")
