sm.sendNext("The single most noticeable trait when you use the Super Transformation is the rock-hard body you'll be sporting. If you really want to see and experience what having a rock-hard body is all about... you should head to Leafre, where you'll encounter a monster called Blue Dragon Turtle. Those turtles are also notorious for possessing rock-hard bodies. I say... how about engaging in a battle with them? Experience first hand how the Blue Dragon Turtles utilize their bodies against the opposition.")
sm.sendSayOkay("If the training ends well, then I'll even give you a small reward. I'll teach you a skill that you can use through Super Transformation. What do you think? Now, go ahead and defeat #r150 Blue Dragon Turtles#k. I also need evidence that you really did slay the Blue Dragon Turtles, so I want you to bring back #b50 pieces of Sturdy Leather#k.")
