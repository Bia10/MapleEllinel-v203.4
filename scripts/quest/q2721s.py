I can't afford them on my salary, but anyone tough enough to fight Blue Mushrooms can get them. Deep inside of the Singing Mushroom Forest, there's a place called Blue Mushroom Forest, just full of them. Please go there and get 10 Blue Mushroom Caps. Once you have them, take them to my wife, Mrs. Ming Ming.")
