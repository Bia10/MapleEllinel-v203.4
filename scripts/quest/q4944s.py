sm.sendNext("I've heard rumors that the ghost of Sophilia still walks the halls of this house. Sometimes... I think I even hear her voice coming from her bedroom.\r\n <shivers> ")
sm.sendSay("Truth be told, that's the real reason why so many of the household staff have deserted the house. They say she still wanders about, seemingly still searching for something. I haven't seen her myself, and I can't imagine what she'd be searching for, but the thought of her not getting what she wants, even if it's only her spirit, well, it's more than I can bear.")
sm.sendSayOkay("When Sophilia was alive, she couldn't get enough of Gummy Slimes, her favorite candy. It's been a long time since we've had them in the pantry. I... I used to keep some in stock just for her. If she's still 'here', I would feel better if we still had some around. Bring me #b80 Gummy Slimes, 20 of each color#k (Red, Green, Orange, and Purple), and I'll give you my #dOmni Key#k, which will allow you to unlock the fireplaces and access the Chimney.")
