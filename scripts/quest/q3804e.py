sm.sendNext("I appreciate your great work, but unfortunately, I don't think I can give you #o5120506#. This was a crude reminder that these skills are definitely not for the unprepared and the untrained. I am sure you may be able to master those skills in no time without the proper training, but that doesn't mean you can call yourself a Master. In fact, you won't be any different from those monsters you just defeated.")
sm.sendSayOkay("This applies to anyone and everyone: the best way to become the Master is to train diligently and pay dues. Once you find yourself helping others in need without even thinking, that's when you'll have proven to be Master material. Don't be discouraged by this; keep training, keep working hard, and never stray from this goal. You'll eventually become the true Master you are striving to become.")
