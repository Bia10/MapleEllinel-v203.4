sm.sendSayOkay("I've heard that monsters have found the sheet music, and are now running amok with it. There should be #b8 different sheet music pages#k you can collect and bring to Cygnus. You can find these pages with #rall normal monsters#k, but not #bmonsters that are 11 levels higher or lower than you#k. Good luck!")
