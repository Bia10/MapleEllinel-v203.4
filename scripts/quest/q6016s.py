sm.sendNext("I have a nephew that lives out west in Ariant. Next month is her 9th birthday. The item I want you to make is a pair of #b#t4001175##k for her. I want nothing more than to make one myself, but I am currently working on a very important order from Carson, so I have no time. That's why I'm asking you to make one for me, since you're usually just spending time doing nothing.")
sm.sendSayOkay("Making itself isn't hard, but I want you to put in your best effort. You know what I mean, right? If you do this right, then I may be open to giving more work to you. Good luck.")
