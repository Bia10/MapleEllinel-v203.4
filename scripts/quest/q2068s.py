sm.sendNext("To start working on the animal fossils, I'll need samples I can compare with. Looking at these fossils, Drake's skulls seem like a perfect sample for comparison. Can you get me some of Drake's skulls?")
sm.sendSay("Ah, don't be too shocked. I know Drakes are not to be messed with for most people. I have #b#t4031151##k that I gathered up a few years ago. The problem is, I didn't bring it with me to Ellinia because I'm here right now for plant fossils. Since I can't leave this place, I'm hoping you can get it for me.")
sm.sendSayOkay("Around Henesys, you'll find my daughter. Ask her for #b#t4031151##k. Her name is #bAnne#k.")
