sm.sendNext("Have you heard of the monster called #o1210102#? You've seen them while you were in Ereve taking on the Acclimation Training, right? Apparently, some of the #o1210102#s in #m100000000# have been displaying some suspicious behavior. They've been seen with sadistic looks on their faces, and they are always found together.")
sm.sendSay("Considering that #o1210102#s are famous for their black, yet bright smiles, this sounds quite a bit odd, don't you think? After further investigation, they were collectively under the spell from Black Mage, and with the Wizard's instruction, they are now ready to attack town anytime soon. Please make sure #o1210102#'s plans do not go as planned!")
sm.sendSay("The #o1210102#s just don't have a clue. All you need to do is hunt down the suspicious #r#o9300274#s#k around #m100000000#. I suspect their home is #bsomewhere North of Henesys#k... Please defeat #r50#k of them. Thanks, and good luck!")
sm.sendSayOkay("Oh, and if you find any suspicious items while hunting #o9300274#, then please bring it back to me. I have a feeling there's something more to it than just those monsters.")
