sm.sendNext("...Oh, Arwen has been attacked by a monster...? Sigh... I'm sorry if she was being obnoxious. She isn't completely wrong. I was once blinded by the magic of darkness when I was young.")

sm.sendSayOkay("There is a mysterious cat named #bFanzy#k at the #bForest North of Ellinia#k. Ask Fanzy about the monster that attacked Arwen. Fanzy always knows what's happening around the Ellinia Forest, so you should be able to get information about that black monkey monster.")
