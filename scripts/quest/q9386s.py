If you're a true adventurer, then you should have #b#t04031297##k. #b#t04031297##k looks like a red envelope with a leaf drawn onto it like this #i04031297#, and it can be found by defeating monsters. If you can find #b1 #t04031297##k from a monster and give it to me, then I'll let you in the party as well.")
