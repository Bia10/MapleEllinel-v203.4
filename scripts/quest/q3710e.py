sm.sendNext("Ahh... this is the vintage scroll from #p1032001# which is of most importance to the Halflingers at this moment. This is the scroll that contains the spell that strengthens the barrier of this forest. Thankfully, you've brought the necessary ingredients for this. Great work. This should be good for a little while, but I'll need to find out why the Barrier of the Forest is weakened.")
sm.sendSayOkay("Anyway, thank you for your great work. The barrier of the forest seems to have weakened quite a bit, so I advise you to stay alert against possible monster attacks in the forest.")
