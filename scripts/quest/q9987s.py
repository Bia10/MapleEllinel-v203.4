sm.sendNext("You seem to be a very curious fellow.  Very well then.  I have a job for you.  The real reason I'm looking for Snow Silk is because I need it to make the Mysterious Fabric.")
sm.sendSay("What is the Mysterious Fabric, you ask?  It's a very rare fabric.  I only heard about it from Arwen, the fairy in Ellinia.  Arwen did seem reluctant to tell me about it though.  But my curiosity got the best of her.  What can I Say?  It's in my nature.  After all, I am a scholar.")
sm.sendSayOkay("According to Arwen, anything made with the Mysterious Fabric will contain special powers.  Aren't you curious about what kind of power?  If you can get #b10 Snow Silks#k, take it to Arwen.  If you catch her on a good day, she'll make you the Mysterious Fabric.")
