sm.sendNext("Calico always does something weird at night instead of sleeping, so whenever he's on duty in the afternoon, that's all he does, nod off. Maybe he doesn't sleep at night because he's asleep in the afternoon. I want to freak Calico out by tossing an Evil Eye Tail on his face. Don't you think he'll freak out like crazy?? Hahaha!")
sm.sendSayOkay("Sounds fun, right? Well then, get #b7 Evil Eye Tails#k and then try throwing them at #bCalico#k. You have to scream that the Evil Eye Tails are snakes, okay? Hahaha! This is going to be great!")
