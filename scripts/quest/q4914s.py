sm.sendSayOkay("Well, if you've heard of Dark Scrolls, you've heard about Subani. He was the powerful magician who sacrificed himself to seal away the evil demon, Naricain. The scrolls are all over the place, but that's not what we're here for. I got a tip from this funny looking guy over in Purplewood Forest, went by the name of Glimmer Man. He mentioned that Subani had a horde of items stashed away, and that the MesoGears would be a good place to look. I did some digging, thanks to the path you cleared, and found some strange markings. I don't know what they say, but I do know that there only one thing that deciphers marking like these - a #b#t4031680##k. It can decipher other languages, but the problem is, you can only use it once, and there are 50 markings. I'll need you to hunt down #b50 #t4031680#s#k so we can keep going. I know we're close to something... Try those weird-looking elephants that shoot electricity. I'm willing to bet they're hiding something in that mechanism on top of their heads! ")
