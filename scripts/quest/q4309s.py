sm.sendNext("Ohh, okay. Thank you for taking up the offer. There are numerous types of mushrooms in this town, and among those, you may find a strange mushroom that sports a blue mushroom cap. I think it's one of those mutant mushrooms, seeing that it's different from other mushrooms. They are much more powerful than other mushrooms, and are also very violent. We need to eliminate those mushrooms before they get really out of hand.")
sm.sendSayOkay("It's called #b#o9400205##k. It sports the same, non-assuming look of other mushrooms, but underneath it lies a very violent mushroom eager to attack at will. Please eliminate it for us.")
