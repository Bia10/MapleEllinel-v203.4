sm.sendNext("A few months ago, my crew and I were sent here from Aquarium to observe the state of the ocean. Lately there had been some strange things happening here, so the crew of four, including myself, were sent here to check out the problem.")
sm.sendSay("But a few days earlier, the rest of the crew that went to check the debris of the wrecked ships went missing. I've been looking around places since then to find them, to no avail.")
sm.sendSay("It would be nice to at least find traces of the men, but something terrible must have happened if I can't find a single thing here since then. Not only that, but ever since they went missing, the path that leads to the bottom of the ocean has been blocked by a black fog. Something doesn't feel right. Please help me find at least the traces left behind by my men.")
sm.sendSay("I think the swarms of sharks that are swimming around this area look suspicious to say the least. I've been looking through the rocks to no avail, so I should start looking through the sharks, but it's really dangerous to do so, and I don't think I can do it by myself.")
sm.sendSayOkay("I see that you're full of courage and strength, since you made it here by yourself. Please help me look into these sharks and find the item that my men carried around, like a #bflashlight#k, a #bcamera#k and a #bnotebook#k, and give them to me.")
