sm.sendSayOkay("Wow... These really are the Maple History Books! How did you...? No way... YOU are the one that #b#p1012109##k mentioned? I am so so sorry, I cannot believe how ignorant I can be sometimes. #b#p1012109##k told me all these nice things, but I didn't expect you to be here early! These 3 books will be handed straight to the King of Ludibrium. Thank you so much, and now my Dad and I can go on 'break' and see something I may like in some other countries. Also, I just asked the King of Ludibrium to award you #t4031160#, but... I made a mistake of leaving it there... can you stop by again later?")
