sm.sendSayOkay("Inside the Jazz Bar, where the Dark Lord resides, there is a secret room. Within that room lies the last remaining article left by my father. It's his #bDiary#k. Please go there and return with the Diary before the entire place is engulfed in war. \r\nTo enter the secret room, you'll have to enter through a small door towards the back of the #bJazz Bar#k counter. Be careful and make sure that the Dark Lord doesn't see you.")
