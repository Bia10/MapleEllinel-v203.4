sm.sendNext("So, about the #r<Pirate King's Treasure Map Book>#k I gave you... I'd love to get started right now, but the thing is, it has a bunch of parts that were ripped out. We're going to have to find those missing pieces if we want to find the treasure. If you gather 6 Pirate King's Treasure Map Pieces from normal monsters each day, I can reassemble the missing parts and stamp them into this book.")
sm.sendSayOkay("Now, #bno matter how often you bring Pirate King's Treasure Map Pieces, you can only receive one stamp per day#k. I can only give stamps for Day 1, Day 3, Day 5, and Day 7, but records for the other days are kept as well. I'll give you some #rawesome rewards for your stamps on Days 1, 3, 5, and 7#k, too! Read the <Pirate King's Treasure Map Book> for more details. Let's do this!")
