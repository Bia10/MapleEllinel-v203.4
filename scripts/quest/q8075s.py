sm.sendNext("Good! Thank you! \nSabitrama Archive Study Committee is being formed right here on the spot!")
sm.sendSay("The archive mentions important facts regarding the ancient herbs. I'll read them out to you.")
sm.sendSay("...\nThe spirit of black and white bids adieu to the land and appears before me. Mark on the two silent spirits, and the spirit will intermingle to transform into the 1st Herb.")
sm.sendSay("...\nWhat do you think of the one that snuffs loneliness and darkness in the cradle, while the soul has long vacated the body? The soul that cannot return must find a soulmate that shall spend the eternity with. You're the doll, and inside, you shall find the 2nd Herb.")
sm.sendSay("...\nRegarding the 3rd Herb, the page itself got ripped out, so there's no way to tell what's written here.\nAn archive that's missing the most important page...what a shame.")
sm.sendSay("Regarding the 3rd Herb, I'll search through other books for clues. I'd appreciate it if you can solve the first two riddles for me.\nCan you do it?\nIn times like this, instincts play a big role in solving the riddles! \nPlease think carefully before acting out on it.")
sm.sendSayOkay("I think, regarding the 1st Herb, I'll have to find the 'spirit of black and white'. Without the two, it'll be difficult to obtain the herb.\nGood luck, committee member!")
