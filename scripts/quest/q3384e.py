sm.sendNext("I'll teach you how to draw the Magic Pentagram on the scroll. Here it is. Memorize each stroke of the pentagram. Practice is the only way you will perfect the drawing of this Magic Pentagram.")
sm.sendSay("Oh, and one important thing. Do you know how to make items on your own? Oh... a Maker skill? Moren was very successful with that skill. If you learned that skill, then you'd have no trouble using this iron.")
sm.sendSayOkay("Equip yourself with the Magic Iron and use the Maker skill, and you'll be able to create a new scroll. It's up to you to choose the types of scroll you'd like to make, and hopefully you'll practice hard enough to make the scroll without fail. I will give you this Iron, hoping that you will put it to good use. Remember that you will always be a student of this lonely old man, and I also hope that you will put my methods to good use.")
