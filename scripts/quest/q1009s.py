sm.sendSay("You've hunted monsters already. Remember what keys you had to use? #bCtrl to attack#k and #bAlt to jump#k, right? And #bZ to pick up the items#k? #nYou can also use the #rKey Config#k on the bottom right of your screen to recalibrate the buttons to your liking.")
sm.sendSay("But what you haven't experienced yet is Job Advancement. To become a more powerful traveler, you need a job! To get one, you'll first have to leave this place, Maple Island, and head to Victoria Island. You need to be at least at level #b10#k to become a Warrior, Bowman, or Thief, and at least level #b8#k to be a Magician. Each job has its pros and cons, so choose carefully.")
sm.sendSayOkay("I didn't tell you EVERYTHING you need to know for the quiz, so make sure to focus. Ready for the questions?")
