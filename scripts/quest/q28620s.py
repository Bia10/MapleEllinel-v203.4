sm.sendSayOkay("Great! The test is really simple. After all, I just want to see if you can resist the temptation to be greedy. \r\n\r\nI'm going to give you this lovely Golden Statue. All you have to do is hold it for 30 minutes and give it back. If you can keep yourself from running away with it or selling it, you pass the test. Do you think you can do that? \r\n\r\nOh, and don't even think about logging out during the test. The Golden Statue will return to me automatically if you do that, and the test won't count.\r\n\r\nOkay, here's the statue. Good luck!")
