sm.sendNext("I don't know why, but the Black Wings are desperately in search of something here in Victoria Island. What they are looking for is called the #bSeal Stone#k. The #o9300344# #p1204002# is controlling monsters to look for the Seal Stone that disappeared. The document reads, #b'there were some unforseen disturbances from an outside force, so we were not able to complete the mission. We need more Teddies to help us so we can find it fast.'#k So they're going to involve more monsters to find it. And that's all it says.")
sm.sendSay("The Seal Stone... I wonder what that is. Whatever it is, I'm sure it is somehow #brelated to the Black Mage#k since the Black Wings are after it. As for the outside disturbances that's mentioned in this document, they may be referring to you.")
sm.sendSayOkay("Not only have you stood in the puppeteer's way a number of times, but you have also discovered their strategy and plans. The puppeteer probably hates you more than anything else right now. Besides, the puppeteer knows your face, right? Please be extra careful. #bSurely, he will come after you#k.")
