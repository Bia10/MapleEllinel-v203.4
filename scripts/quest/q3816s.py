sm.sendNext("Thanks. As you may well know, physical training, if not done right, can cause serious damage to your body. Recently, a growing number of students have been injured here, and I think the main reason is because everyone here looks... lethargic. As a trainer, I feel the need to get some medicine for these students.")
sm.sendSayOkay("Of course, the best medicine for stamina is #b#t2022144##k! That should do the trick on all these lethargic students. #b#p2091002##k should know how to make it, so I guess I'll talk to him. I need the ingredients to make it, so take #b10 #t4000281#s#k and ask for #t2022144#. The rest of the ingredients will be prepared by #p2091002#.")
