sm.sendNext("Oh~ You must've heard about it already?  It makes sense...after all, you are an adventurer...  There's something called #bMaple Syrup#k. ")
sm.sendSay("Every year around this time, #bMaple Syrup#k is made by finely crushing #b#t04001126##k and adding heat to it.  It's not difficult to make but because mastering the timing and proper temperature is hard, people rarely attempt it.  But recently I learned how to make it from #p9000021# and now I'm pretty good at it~")
sm.sendSayOkay("I can confidently Say that I am the best Maple Syrup maker in all of Maple World!  To make #bMaple Syrup#k, you'll need #b25 #t04001126##k...  Come back to me once you have 25 #t04001126# ready.")
