sm.sendSayOkay("Great! See, we came up with a Commemorative Stamp for everyone. Of course, what better symbol is there than the red maple leaf of MapleStory? The thing is, we accidentally shipped them to the dungeons instead of the towns. #t3994389#s can be obtained from regular monsters, so bring me 50 of them. You won't find any on monsters who are more than 10 levels below you or 20 levels above you, though.")
