sm.sendNext("During the #rMaple 7th Anniversary#k, the fairies of music have taken the #bHandbells#k for the notes Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La, Ti, and Do, and have hidden them around Maple World. We have no idea why they do this.")
sm.sendSay("Unfortunately, we need these Handbells. They look like this: #i03994271#, but in different colors. I was lucky enough to find the first one, Do. You should be able to obtain the other seven Handbells by hunting monsters. However, #bmonsters that are 11 levels higher or lower than your level do not have the Handbells#k, so hunt monsters close to your level.")
sm.sendSayOkay("After you have collected all 8 Handbells, take the Dimensional Mirror to the Rising Star Hall, and give them to #rLilin#k. The Handbells should help #rLilin#k practice her singing. I know you can do it, #b#h0##k!")
