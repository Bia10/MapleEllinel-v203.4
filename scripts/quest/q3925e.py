sm.sendNext("The Red Scorpion's hideout is in The Scorching Desert, so the treasures they've stolen should be there as well. A suspicious man stands in front of the hideout like a guard. The thing is, even if you find the place, you won't be able to go in. The door can only be open by yelling out the magic words.")
sm.sendSay("So you need to discover the password, then go to their hideout and steal their stolen treasures. What's the password? Hah...#byou probably already know it#k. It is a bandit hideout in the middle of a desert, after all. Afterwards, drop those treasures at secret stash spots in various homes in town. That's what I'd call revenge, served piping hot in this case!")
sm.sendSayOkay("Oh, and if you see an X on any of the houses, then that means it belongs to a known thief, so stay away. Once you've robbed the robbers, let me know, alright? I'd love to hear details on how the Red Scorpions got a taste of their own medicine.")
