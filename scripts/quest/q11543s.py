Once you have enough, release it in the form of the Going Green skill!\n\nYou can see a list of hunting grounds to charge your Cosmic Green in the #rCosmic Green Field Info#k. Click on the Event Notifier on the left side of the screen to check it. Fill up your Cosmic Green, and use the #bGoing Green#k skill once. That's your mission, brave Eco Mapleteer!")
