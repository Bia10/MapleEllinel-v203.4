sm.sendNext("Yes! YES! I knew you were cool, I could tell because you don't wear a big stupid hat. I hate guys in big stupid hats!")
sm.sendSay("I was out here, just minding my own business, putting on a full-on top-spinning clinic, and the Daimyo walks by.")
sm.sendSay("I was all like, 'Hey Daimyo!', cause me and him are pals since the whole toad thing happened, and you know what he did?")
sm.sendSay("He kicked my top into the stream! And a big old koi popped up and ate it! He didn't even say sorry! The Daimyo, not the koi. I've never heard a koi talk.")
sm.sendSay("It wasn't like him at all... And now I've gotta make a brand new top, and the only way to do that is with some decent wood. I bet something like a Genin Doll would get a real nice spin going.")
sm.sendSay("I'm not equipped to deal with this! I don't know from fishing and I don't know from fighting! I only know from spinning.")
sm.sendSayOkay("You're tough, right? Can you get me 50 #b#t4000337#s#k from the #b#o9400400##k? It'd be tops!")
