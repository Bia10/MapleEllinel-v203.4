sm.sendSayOkay("It really isn't much. A few days ago, a group of #o5120501#s#k went into my herb farm, disguising themselves as ginsengs, and sucked away all the nutrients from the fertilizer, and they've been doing that ever since. My request here is that I want you to take out #r80 #o5120501#s#k so that the ginsengs will grow as planned, not like the crop I have here right now. It's really easy, as long as you can distinguish the two.")
