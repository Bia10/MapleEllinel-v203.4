sm.sendSay("#bYou wouldn't even find an officer or commander near #m310000000# anyway#k. Anyone of any importance is off on their own missions, working to collect resources and artifacts.")
sm.sendSay("In fact, the only person you MIGHT have a chance to run into is the founder of the Black Wings! I've heard he or she was working to #bextract a great deal of energy from #m310000000##k, but you'd have more luck finding a fairy under the rocks.")
