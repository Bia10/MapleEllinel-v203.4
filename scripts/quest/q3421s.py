sm.sendNext("Sweet! What I wanted to ask you to do is to collect samples of the asteroids that recently fell. Apparently, the aliens, while making their way here, landed hard, to the point of having quite a number of asteroids dropping around Omega Sector. My boss said that by collecting samples, it'll immensely help our level of science in Omega Sector.")
sm.sendSayOkay("I've received reports of there being a lot of high-quality meteorites, which'll be useful for research, in the nearby Kulan Field. Go to Kulan Field and retrieve them. Search all the meteorites and get me 5 of the #b#t4031117##k items. I'll be waiting here, so get me those samples!")
