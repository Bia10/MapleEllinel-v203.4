sm.sendNext("Thank you. Remember when Lionel first came here, full of scars? Well, at the time, Lionel's white fur intermingled with quite a few strands of brown hair. After looking up, it turned out that those were that of #b#o5130104##k. \nYes, Lionel got attacked by #b#o5130104##k. That is why Lionel kept shivering at night when hearing the wolves howl at night.")
sm.sendSayOkay("The request is, I want you to gather up #b#t04000051##k. I want to show them to Lionel so it can grow out of the fear of the wolves. I know it's a little too straight-forward, but I can't think of another way. \nOkay. Can you gather up #b100 #t04000051#s#k?")
