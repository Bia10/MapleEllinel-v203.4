sm.sendSayOkay("Here is the Legendary Ore. It is told that only a true hero of MapleStory can change this ore to gold. To make a trophy, I need that special gold, but I can't change this ore because I'm not a hero. \r\n\r\nIf you are indeed a true hero, hold on to this ore for 30 minutes and bring it back to me once it's changed to gold. If you log out in the middle, the ore will disappear so be careful. I will give you a chance to receive a trophy with that gold.\r\n")
