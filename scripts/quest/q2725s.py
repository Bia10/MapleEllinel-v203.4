sm.sendSayOkay("That's great! I'm so swamped with my research right now! I've got papers to write and toads to electrocute. Don't ask, it's very science-y. So, assistant, you need to go to the Golem's Temple right away. Just head east from the Windflower Forest of the Singing Mushroom Forest to get to the entrance. Now, I can't do any research without samples, can I? Bring me 40 Stone Golem Rubbles from the Stone Golems at the temple entrance. I don't care how you extract them, just do whatever you have to do. And do it fast! I've got a presentation coming up and I can't afford to be late!")
