sm.sendSayOkay("Having a healthy, powerful body is essential in preventing the Puppeteer from wreaking havoc in Maple World. While other agents concentrate on gathering information, I want you to concentrate on training so you can make yourself stronger for more difficult missions that may await you. I need you to be at least #bLevel 25#k in order for me to give you the next assignment.")
