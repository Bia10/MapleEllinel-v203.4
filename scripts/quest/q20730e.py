sm.sendSayOkay("Black Wings are a group of followers of Black Mage. They long for the time when Black Mage controlled the world and would do anything to bring the Wizard back to life and regain control of the world. I can't believe the #o9300285# was also a member of the Black Wings. It looks like they'll become active once more.")
