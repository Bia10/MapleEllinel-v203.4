sm.sendSay("Hey, do you know how to get to #m100000000#? Henesys is located on Victoria Island. If you take the #bPortal on top of the steps of the Crossroads of Ereve#k and go to the #bSky Ferry#k, you will see an Airship. You can go to Victoria Island by talking to #bKiriru#k, and then taking the ship that is headed toward #bVictoria Tree Platform#k.")
sm.sendSay("Ellinia is not too far from Henesys... Make sure you check the Henesys Portal before going.")
sm.sendSayOkay("Find Roca when you reach Henesys. He'll give you your mission. Oh, and don't forget to ask #p1101001# for a blessing on your way out. Best of luck to you!")
