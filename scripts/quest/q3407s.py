sm.sendNext("Thank you for making some time with me. I have heard that someone's been looking for the boxes, but I didn't think much of it, until one day, the Boxes of Parts disappeared totally. The Boxes of Parts have been stolen, and I think it's the work of the aliens. Maybe they were just worried about the possibility of our new robot controlling their livelihood.")
sm.sendSayOkay("The one good thing is that, thanks to the automatic-returning device I attached to all the boxes, even the most intricate of the responses will generate a signal that'll enable us to locate where the boxes are located at. They may have broken the device, but I don't think they completely destroyed it. The Boxes of Parts are hidden at the Boswell Field. Go there, and you may find a box that looks like that of the aliens. Your task is to destroy that box and bring back the Box of Parts.")
