sm.sendNext("Thanks so much for agreeing to help. Upon examining the Ripped Scroll Pieces you brought me, my findings suggest that the shadow ghost is the #bBamboo Warrior#k.")
sm.sendSay("The #bBamboo Warrior#k used to disturb Herb Town, and the town residents eventually drove him out. They assumed that he had disappeared for good, but who knew he'd turn into a monster and come back for revenge? Please, defeat the Bamboo Warrior. We'd like to be rid of this nuisance once and for all.")
sm.sendSayOkay("According to those who witnessed the appearance of the Bamboo Warrior, he mostly appears in the #b60-Year-Old Herb Garden#k. You can go alone if you'd like, but I recommend you forming a party. I hear he's quite formidable.")
