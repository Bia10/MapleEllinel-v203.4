sm.sendNext("Great! You're not a moron! It's all about #b#eStar Force Enhancements#k#n, pal, which you can use after using up all the upgrade count on a piece of equipment.")
sm.sendSay("Step one, enhance your gear with scrolls until you use up all the upgrade count. Your gear'll be strong, yeah, but now, with the power of the stars, you can make it even stronger. All it takes is a few star-powered items... which you can buy with mesos.")
sm.sendSay("Don't give me that look, pal. Mesos are convenient! ")
sm.sendSay("#i3800730#\r\nWhen you've got everything ready, simple enhance. Your success chance will depend on the current enhancement level. Come closer, pal, and I'll let you in on a little secret.")
sm.sendSay("When you start the enhancement, you'll see a little something like this: \r\n#i3800731#\r\nYou've got to stop at the right spot for a better chance of success. Failing isn't a huge deal, but these stars are unpredictable. The more you try, the harder it gets.\r\n")
sm.sendSay("Stars are really powerful, and a piece of equipment can only take so much. Higher-level equipment can endure more star enhancement.")
sm.sendSay("One warning, though. If you fail at a 12-star or higher enhancement, the equipment might get destroyed. If it does, it'll leave a trace.\r\n #i3800732#\r\nThat trace can transfer all stats, minus the star power, on to another piece of equipment of the same name. Since all powers are carried over, it'd be best if the new equipment had lower stats.")
sm.sendSayOkay("To access this system, you can use the enhancement icon on the left or its hotkey. By default it should be #b'O'#k. Well, hope I helped you out, pal. Now you owe me.")
