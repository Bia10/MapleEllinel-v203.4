sm.sendSayOkay("I really hope so. I don't know why I can't fall asleep on Christmas Eve. Maybe I'm too excited about it! I was really sad the past two years since I didn't get anything from Santa Claus, but now that you've told me about it I can finally go to bed. Thanks! Santa Claus will come visit me this time, right? Please thank Roodolph for me.")
