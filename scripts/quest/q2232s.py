sm.sendNext("Good good, I like how active you are in this front. Of course, it's not a guarantee that you will become the Leader, but... if you wish to start a Family, you'll need to learn a few things. The most important thing you'll need to understand is the relationship between the #bJunior#k and the #bSenior#k.")
sm.sendSay("#bJunior#k is a character you'll be sponsoring. Yes, the character is probably going to be below you in level, but you cannot be more than 20 levels higher than your Junior. In order to add one, #rpress Add Jr. on the Family window [HotKey: F]#k or #rFamily Pedigree#k. Once the person you've entered as the Junior agrees to it, that character becomes your Junior.")
sm.sendSay("This is when you become the #bSenior#k. If you do not have a Senior of your own, then you can be the Leader of the Family, but a Leader is really no different from that of a Senior. \nA Senior's responsibility is to fully support his or her Juniors, and by doing so, you'll be able to increase your Rep. If the Senior neglects to take care of the Junior, then the Junior will most definitely leave the Senior and search for a Senior that will provide proper support. Please be aware that providing support is not limited to providing money or items; rather, you should pay attention to how the Juniors are doing exploring the world of Maple.")
sm.sendSayOkay("Okay, enough talking. I want you to now look for a capable Junior you'd like to take care of. Register at least one Junior, and then talk to me afterwards. Best of luck to you!")
