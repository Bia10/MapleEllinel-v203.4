sm.sendNext("Alchemy... The union between magic and science isn't just a scholastic union. It's uncharted territory, so discovery is important. Your studies will definitely affect the whole continent in one way or the other. Think about the Flying Ship. The inventions made by the alchemists enrich the lives of everyone in this world. ")
sm.sendSay("But don't forget about this one crucial point. This has to be achieved without disturbing the nature's course. You shall never stray away from that, like the Alcadnos. If you partake in their questionable methods, then you may end up losing what power you may have right now.")
sm.sendSay("Anyway, you are now officially a Zenumist. Please wear the cape wherever you go. Without it, no one will recognize you as a Zenumist, so don't ever lose it. It's the cape that ultimately differentiates Zenumist from Alcadno. Along with our sense of humor. Ha.")
sm.sendSayOkay("Keep this in mind. If you want to engage in serious conversations with other Zenumists, you MUST wear the cape. #bWear it#k, not just carry it around in your inventory.")
