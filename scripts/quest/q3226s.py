sm.sendNext("Thank you so much. Now, here's the story. I've actually been declared missing for 10 months now, but I have no recollection of what happened during the 10 months that I've been deemed missing. It's like, I woke up one day, and 10 months have passed, just like that. Isn't that strange?")
sm.sendSay("I couldn't sleep for a while because I was in shock. Luckily, there were people around me to bring me back to my senses, and I slowly started living a normal life again when two men dressed in dark suits came to me. They proceeded to ask me questions regarding the last 10 months, then left.")
sm.sendSay("I'm sure those men know what had happened to me. Please go find the #e'Men in Black'#n and find out what they know. I don't think they'll be in Ludibrium or Eos Tower...")
sm.sendSayOkay("#b(Men in black... Maybe they're from Omega Sector? That place seems weird enough.)#k")
