sm.sendNext("But I can't just give you a job advancement that easily. I need you to prove yourself worthy of it. Brawlers use brute strength, steel fists, and their full bodies' power to eliminate all opposition. In order to become a commendable Brawler, you'll need to be good with your fists! Prove to me that you are.")
sm.sendSayOkay("It's simple really. You'll just need to head to the test room where I'll send you, and fight #rOctopirates#k. Your task is to bring back #b15 Potent Power Crystals#k. You think it's easy? Then think again. These Octopirates can only be attacked with #rFlash Fist#k. Other attacks will be fruitless. It may be tough, but any honorable Brawler must go through this. Good luck...")
