sm.sendNext("Have you ever smelled something rotting in the forest? No?\nYour senses must be dull. I'm the opposite, though. I'm overly sensitive, and that rotting smell has been killing me!")
sm.sendSayOkay("Anyway, that rotting smell comes from #rDark Stumps#k.\nAnd I was wondering if you could eliminate 40 #rDark Stumps#k to clear the air a little. I would have a much easier time breathing the air if you do that for me. You'll find a lot of them in either #b#m100040000##k or #b#m101010102##k.")
