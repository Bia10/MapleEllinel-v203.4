sm.sendNext("Good choice, I'll start with how to use #b#escroll enhancements#k#n on your equipment to strengthen them.")
sm.sendSay("You need some #i4001832# #bSpell Traces#k to use the scroll enhancement. You can get them from hunting monsters or extracting them from scrolls. \r\nTo extract scrolls, use another player's extractor or a professional skill, Alchemy, that you can learn when you're at least Lv. 35. \r\n")
sm.sendSay("#i3800632#\r\nFirst, check your remaining upgrades on the equipment you want to enhance.")
sm.sendSay("#i3800635#\r\nThe equipment and the available scrolls will be marked. Select one of them and click 'Start Enhancement'. Easy, right? \r\nBut don't forget to collect enough #i4001832# #bSpell Traces#k!")
sm.sendSay("Now, your enhancements may fail, depending on what kind of scroll you choose. If you fail, the equipment will not be enhanced but you still lose the upgrade count.")
sm.sendSay("To access the system, you can use the enhancement icon on the left side of the screen or a hotkey. The default hotkey is #b'O'#k.")
sm.sendSay("Not only can you use #i4001832# #bSpell Traces#k for scroll enhancements, but you can also buy whole scrolls with them. To do that, drag the scroll directly onto the equipment or use the hammer icon on the Inventory window.")
sm.sendSayOkay("There's a rumor that you can enhance equipment even if they're upgrade counts have all been used up. I can't say for sure, though... Anyway, I hope this helps you out! ")
