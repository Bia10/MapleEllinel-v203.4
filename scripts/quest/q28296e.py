sm.sendNext("Would you care to know the truth, dear #b#h0##k? That ghost wasn't just any ordinary ghost. It was the ghost of Olivia...the daughter of Master Jonas! She was the neglected, forgotten child. The poor girl, being spurned, returned to the land of the living to seek revenge on her father. After all, she had died of starvation. She starved to her very grave. How can you let your own child die of hunger? ")
sm.sendSay("But upon her return, she found Master Jonas and his family had long been dead, so she directed her wrath instead to all of Maplekind. From my understanding, she had composed all sorts of traps. But thanks to you, we no longer have to fear. ")
sm.sendSayOkay("Anyway, here is your reward, as promised. It is #bOlivia's Chair#k. Sit on it, give it away, or use it for firewood. Whatever the case, I'm just glad you didn't become a victim of this cruel twist of fate. What a tragic story. It really is.")
