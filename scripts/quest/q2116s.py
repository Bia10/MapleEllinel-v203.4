sm.sendNext("I can't thank you enough for stepping up for Perion. New monsters have been popping up lately, with the land around Perion rapidly deteriorating. Recent reports suggest that a mutant version of the Stumps, #r#o1140100#s#k, have been roaming around the area. ")
sm.sendSay("Due to my tireless research of the #o1140100#, I found out that the branches on the head of the #o1140100# can be planted and they will grow into a big tree. I guess you could say it's a type of #t4000195#. I would appreciate it if you could go toward the Excavation Site, defeat #o1140100#, and then bring me #b9 #t4000195#s#k.")
sm.sendSayOkay("#o1140100# appears quite often around the excavation site. The way to get there is quite simple. Head all the way East until you reach #r#m102020400##k. There, you'll see a portal at the very top. Enter the portal to head to the excavation site.")
