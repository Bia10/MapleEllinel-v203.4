sm.sendNext("My name is #p2161003#. I'm a locksmith, and I was born in El Nath. I was working in Ludibrium for a while, and came back to El Nath after saving up some money. But when I returned, my brother was missing. ")
sm.sendSay("I asked around everywhere, but no one knew my brother's whereabouts. I thought he ran away from home, but he's too much of a pansy to do that. I decided to look for him myself...I figured he got stuck in a snowdrift or something.")
sm.sendSay("But I couldn't find him anywhere! Eventually, I ended up here. No one comes here...I remember this area used to be blocked, so I thought it was strange that it was open. And guess what I found? My brother was held captive here!")
sm.sendSay("I couldn't just leave him, but a weak guy like me couldn't save him, either. That's why I needed a strong adventurer. And I finally found one... sniff sniff... My hero.")
sm.sendSayOkay("I bet you're wondering how I got here if I'm so weak, huh? Well, I used the ultimate weak-guy technique: Play Dead. Yep, I'm a master at it. Sometimes I fall asleep while doing it and get frostbite. I'm that good.")
