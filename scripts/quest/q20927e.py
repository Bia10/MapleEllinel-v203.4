sm.sendNext("So... Um... The Black Wings took control of #bEdelstein#k to strip it of its natural resources so that they can revive the #rBlack Mage#k, right?")
sm.sendSay("Well, some people in #bEdelstein#k didn't like that, so they formed the #bResistance#k. The Empress and her knights grouped up with them, since we have a common enemy and all.")
sm.sendSay("The Resistance came up with this amazing plan to defeat the #bBlack Wings#k once and for all, but they needed our help. We promised to send #bCygnus Knights#k to their aid on the day of the battle.")
sm.sendSay("But, when the day came, #rsomething unexpected#k happened to us. We could barely defend ourselves, let alone help #bEdelstein#k! \r\nI... I can't talk about what happened to us. It still gives me nightmares. *shudder*")
sm.sendSay("In the end, we managed to protect Ereve and the Empress, but at a heavy, heavy cost. And because of our absence, the Black Wings crushed Edelstein.")
sm.sendSay("Do you get it now? Everyone here, even the kids, see the #bCygnus Knights#k as traitors.")
sm.sendSayOkay("They refuse to have anything to do with us, so you're not likely to get much help from them.")
