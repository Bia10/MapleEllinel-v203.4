sm.sendNext("You may have heard that the Explorers and the Cygnus Knights have joined forces to form the #bMaple Alliance#k. I suppose they had to stop ignoring the Black Mage's threat sooner or later. I've carefully considered what role the Dual Blades will play in the coming conflict.")
sm.sendSay("They argue that we must join forces as a simple matter of #bjustice#k. I'm not so delusion to buy into their 'justice' talk, of course, but this may still presents an interesting opportunity for us. We will join their Alliance under the banner of 'Dual Blades,' distinct and separate from Thieves.")
sm.sendSay("Our forces are greater than all of the other Explorers combined. Of course they want us to join them... Our first goal is to earn their fear and respect by proving our strength. Our second goal is to gain our own sovereign domain in Victoria Island once the war is over. We will emerge from the shadows of Kerning City triumphant.")
sm.sendSayOkay("#b#h0##k, deliver our intent to join the Maple Alliance to the #bDark Lord#k. He is well respected among the Explorers, and his words will carry weight. Go now.")
