sm.sendNext("Many have claimed to be Calico Mack in his absence, but recently, it would seem the real Pirate King has returned. It's just that he seems to be everywhere at once! Maybe while he was gone, he gained some kind of power...? Whatever the case, if you can catch him and defeat him, I'm sure you can score some amazing treasures! ")
sm.sendSayOkay("Now, let me just warn you... #rYou cannot get a treasure chest from Calico Mack if the one you fight is at least 11 levels lower or 21 levels higher than you#k. With that in mind, there are specific places you can fight him.\n\n#bLv. 13 - 27: Golem's Temple \nLv. 28 - 39: Kerning Square 1st and 2nd Floors\nLv. 40 - 52: Garden of Three Colors 2\nLv. 53 - 64: Korean Folk Town\nLv. 65 - 73: Boswell Field\nLv. 74 - 81: Sahel Desert\nLv. 82 - 94: Magatia Alcadno Research Institute\nLv. 95 - 109: Red-Nose Pirate Den\nLv. 110 - 126: Kentaurus Area\nLv. 127 - 144: Dragon Forest\nLv. 145 and up: Road of Regrets#k\n\nNow, those are just suggestions. As long as the Calico Mack you find is at the right level, it doesn't matter where you find him. You can see that list again in the #rquest completion window#k for Enter the Pirate King. All right then, good luck!\r\n\r\n")
