sm.sendNext("I'll tell you why I'm angry.\n\nWhen I visited Perion awhile back, I received a traditional Statue of Perion as a gift of friendship. That was pretty common back then, since the two towns had built a very co-dependent and caring relationship. But the problem followed immediately after that.")
sm.sendSayOkay("On my way back to Henesys, I was attacked by a warrior from Perion and had my Statue stolen! What's the logic behind their custom? You give a present, then steal it back from the recipient? Can it get more incredibly offensive than that?\nFortunately, I was able to save myself from danger, yet I can't help but harbor these feelings against all things related to Perion.")
