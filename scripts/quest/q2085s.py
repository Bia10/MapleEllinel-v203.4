sm.sendNext("I knew you'd help me out. I really appreciate it! Anyway, I have a fairy friend, and his name is Wing. He lives in Ellinia, so it's hard to see him frequently, but we're still really close.")
sm.sendSayOkay("Since Wing is a fairy, I'm sure he knows a way to make me fly. Please find out what #bWing#k has to offer in terms of me flying! Since I'm a long way from Ellinia, I don't think I can go there myself. Can you go there for me and ask?")
