sm.sendSayOkay("Thank you...my husband, Richard, is a sailor on Tae Gong's ship over in Aqua Road. He works all the time and I do love him, but I barely get to see him. I would like to send a few things to him, but I don't know how to fight. I'll need you to gather #b25 Soft Feathers#k and bring them to him on the boat along with the letter I wrote for him. If you do so, I'll have something nice for you when you get back.")
