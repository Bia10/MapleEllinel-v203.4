sm.sendNext("Wonderful. Over a decade ago, my brother Manji went into a colossal cave in the middle of this island. He discovered the Balrog, spoken of in stories and legends. Those large wings, and fangs as sharp as any blade...")
sm.sendSay("He knew he could not defeat it, and prepared for the end when it charged him. Right then, a man with a mysterious, glimmering blade appeared. The man held off Balrog long enough for Manji to escape. ")
sm.sendSay("That man was the great hero, Tristan. #rMy brother got out safely thanks to him, but Tristan was wounded and fell over the cliff. My brother rushed down to find him, and saw that he was not long for this world. Tristan gave Manji the #t1302014# and closed his eyes. Now, my brother wants to restore the gladius to its original state.")
sm.sendSay("When the gladius reawakens, it will turn into the #b#t1302015##k. First, we need to purge it of Balrog's evil energy. Go to #p1061000# in #m105040300#. He'll know how.")
sm.sendSay("I went all the way down to where he ultimately fell. He didn't look like he had much of a chance. Before it was too late, he handed me the #b#t1302014##k, by then worn-out by the sheer evil of Balrog, and then passed away. This is that same sword right here. I would love to restore this to its original state.")
sm.sendSayOkay("The sword becomes #b#t1302015##k once it is reawakened. However, as for the details of how to reawaken it, I have no idea. I think you have to eliminate the evil force of Balrog, though... You should go see #p1061000# from #m105040300# and ask about it.")
