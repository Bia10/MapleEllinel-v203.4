sm.sendNext("Oh, thank you... actually, the moment you came and talk to me, I had a feeling that you'd help me out on something like this Our job is to recover #bMaple History Books#k, which has every historical detail of this world from its creation. What happened was... well, this is going to take a while, so you may want to grab a seat next to me.")
sm.sendSay("These books have been kept safely by important people in this place, until something happened recently. One of those books have been safely kept away, but... the other two books are either stolen or at least in danger of being stolen. We need to find #ball 3 volumes of [Maple History Book]#k and give them to #r#p2041022# of Ludibrium#k.")
sm.sendSay("#b#t4031157##k, the one that covers the creation of MapleStory, was on its way to Orbis, along with the person responsible for it, but... nothing's been heard from the person since. I don't think the book is in someone else's hands, and... It should be somewhere out there... we lost contact of him #rafter boarding on the ship to Orbis#k... Was he ambushed by #o8150000#? Maybe it's hidden well inside the ship...")
sm.sendSay("#b#t4031158##k contains the developmental part of MapleStory, and how it rose to become the society that it is today. That book is #rwell taken care of by Grendel the Really Old of Ellinia, who stores it in a box back at home#k, so all you need to do is ask him for a favor, and he'll give the book to you.")
sm.sendSayOkay("Lastly, #b#t4031159##k is apparently #rstolen by a bunch of #o3230306#'s in Ludibrium#k. Defeat a whole group of #o3230306#'s and one of them may actually cough-up the book. The book contains important information on the background of the monsters' stories, along with ways to combat them. This book should never be in the hands of a monster. Please gather up all 3 books and deliver them to #b#p2041022##k?\n\n#i4031157#  #i4031158#  #i4031159#")
