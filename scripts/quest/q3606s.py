sm.sendNext(" I'm the messenger from the God of Sky, and I am in a little bit of a tight spot right now. I was carrying a present from the God of Sky for this man that took care of my broken leg last spring, but while I was resting at the top of the mountain, I dropped it somewhere, and now I can't find it.")
sm.sendSayOkay("So I went into the woods looking for that lost seed, only to find a bunch of angry rabbits chasing me. That's how I clipped my wing, frantically trying to fly away from those rabbits. If the lord found out that I have lost the seed, then I'll be harshly reprimanded for this! Pleeeeeease help me find the seed. I have a feeling that it's one of those rabbits that have the seed. I am pretty sure of that!")
