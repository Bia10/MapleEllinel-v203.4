sm.sendNext("Alright, my research suggests that jumping is a mating ritual for mushrooms. Think about it. Our jumping is all very instinctive, much like love! Doesn't it all line up?")
sm.sendSay("Now to test this... I should mention... Understand this isn't for me, it's for science... Oh, I've fallen in love! Her name is Julietta. ")
sm.sendSay("But she's just not interested in me. I suspect she's more into bad boy 'shrooms than the nice, intelligent, civil ones like myself. You know, like the Horny Mushrooms with all those pointy horns. Life is so hard.")
sm.sendSay("Our task is quite simple. I just need to show Julietta a super-duper crazy high jump. #bI will call her up and when I give the signal, you must throw me high into the air.#k I'll be the best mush-jumper that ever lived!")
sm.sendSayOkay("Ahem, I think I was a bit too excited about my research. It's not a good look for a researcher, but this is the best method I can think of. Talk to me when you are ready.")
