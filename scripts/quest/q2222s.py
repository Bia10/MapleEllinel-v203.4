sm.sendNext("Not too long ago, a monster that was never seen in the forest before appeared. It was a monster that resembled a monkey, only atrocious like the darkness of the forest and gigantic. This nefarious monster had to have been created by magic. What does this have to do with humans? ")
sm.sendSay("Didn't you hear...? A while back, #p1032001# had gotten involved with the magic of darkness... It was for a short time, but the magic spell he had casted then is affecting all around #m101000000#! The monster had to have been created because of that too!")
sm.sendSayOkay("Saying it was a mistake he made when he was young is not a good enough excuse! How could he neglect to do anything about the monster, simply concluding that there isn't anything he can do? Please go find #b#p1032001##k and tell him to defeat the atrocious monster he's created at once!")
