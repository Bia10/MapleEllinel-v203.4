sm.sendSayOkay("Well, I have something here called a #bNexon Prepaid#k. It comes in 2 kinds: #b100 points#k and #b250 points#k. These are available wherever you see the store that I work in, #rTarget#k. You will need your #bAllowance#k from Mom and Dad to get one, though. I can give you the Mouse you want for free if you come back later to get a #bNexon Prepaid#k. Keep the card, and in two weeks it will turn into actual Maple Points you can use. Here's the mouse you need. Hurry back!")
