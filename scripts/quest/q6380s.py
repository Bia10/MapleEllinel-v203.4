sm.sendNext("Okay, here's your mission. You are probably still not very good at navigating around with the Battleship. You'll need to have great control over it in order to use other skills. What I'm suggesting here is... how about observing how others sail with ships, or how to fight while on it? If you really watch for it, you'll figure it out, and you'll be better with the Battleship, right?")
sm.sendSayOkay("Go to Ludibrium and you'll encounter a bunch of #rSpirit Vikings#k. Observe them carefully, and when you feel like you've picked them apart, defeat #r150#k of them. I also need to see an evidence from you that you really did slay them all, so I want you bring #b50 Spirit Viking Flags#k with you. If I see that you have really trained yourself in this session, then I'll teach you a new skill.")
