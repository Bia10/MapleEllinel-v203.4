sm.sendSayOkay("This letter is written by Kyrin to Athena Pierce in Henesys. The two have a complicated history going on there, and that's why I think Kyrin wrote it, but was never able to actually give it to her. I want you to take this letter, go to #bHenesys#k and give it to #bAthena Pierce#k.")
