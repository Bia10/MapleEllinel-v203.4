sm.sendNext("Okay, now I'll tell you how to get to Korean Folk Town through the sky. First, head over to the station in #bEllinia#k. The ship that heads to #bOrbis#k should leave every 15 minutes. The station at Orbis is gigantic, and once there, you'll need to switch the flight to the ship that heads to #bLudibrium#k. At Ludibrium, it features two humongous towers, and you need to head over to #bHelios Tower#k and descend your way all the way down until you reach Korean Folk Town.")
sm.sendSayOkay(" Alright, now talk to me once more so I can give you all the necessary items for the travel.")
