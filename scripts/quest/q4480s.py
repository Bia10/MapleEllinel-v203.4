sm.sendNext("There is an article about my husband... Well that's what media is saying but the real truth behind is this...")
sm.sendSay("People say that they haven't got the presents from Santa Claus last year, but in fact, my husband DID visit every single house in Maple World with presents. Unfortunately, quality of the socks that the children hung were all bad which was inevitable for Santa Claus to leave the house without putting in the gift.")
sm.sendSay("You might think that the quality of the socks doesn't matter as long as they are hung inside the houses. However, if the size or the flexibility does not meet the standard, it is really difficult to put in the gifts. So, the all the gifts that my husband has prepared for year was left in stock. He was very worried about paying the remainder and finally decided to leave home.")
sm.sendSay("I guess he was very distressed not even to tell his own wife. I am extremely worried... I have no idea where he is or what he is doing. He shouldn't reach far away from here though. I can tell that he is wandering around the usual place just like old days...")
sm.sendSayOkay("Please talk to me in a little while if you would like to continue to listen to my story. I am getting thirsty from this conversation. I haven't had such a long conversation like this for a long time.")
