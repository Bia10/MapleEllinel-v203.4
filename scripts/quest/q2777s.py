sm.sendSayOkay("Now that I think about it, there's really no way that #b#p1032002##k DIDN'T make these dolls, yeah? I suppose what we need to figure out is why. Maybe he had a good reason for making evil zombifying dolls... Actually, that's just stupid. Just find him #bin the upper left of #m101000000##k and see what he has to say.")
