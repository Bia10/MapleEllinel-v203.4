sm.sendNext("Exploring mechanical dolls is not easy, but since you've worked so hard to get me all the materials, it is my turn to pay you back by really studying these babies. Then one of these days, I'll be able to fulfill #b#p2111003#'s wish#k, right?")
sm.sendSay("#p2111003# is a mechanical doll. Unlike #o5110301#, which doesn't think, it's a mechanical doll that acts like a human being. #p2111003#, however, wants to become human.")
sm.sendSay("#p2111003# is so kind and gentle. He's not human, but he seems like one... that's why... #p2111005# wants to do everything to help fulfill #p2111003#'s wish.")
sm.sendSayOkay("If you can get more #t4000362#s from #o7110300#, then please get as much as you can. Once I completely disassemble it and go through it, I'll need more of those to explore different sides of it. So if you find more #t4000362#s, then please bring them to me in 3 days. It takes 3 days to go through one heart, so AFTER 3 days!")
