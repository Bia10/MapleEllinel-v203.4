sm.sendSay("Besides, I really don't like #p2152018#. Just looking at his gloomy face makes me depressed. Not that I like #p2152016#, either. He's so fat. Aren't there any good-looking people in this town?")
sm.sendSayOkay("In any case, just deliver the report to #p2152018#. And don't even think about reading it. It's a secret document and only the bosses are supposed to see. Even #p2152016# and #p2152018# are not allowed to see it. Not that you can read it since it's written in code...")
