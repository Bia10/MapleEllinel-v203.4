sm.sendNext("Anyone who does well will receive a reward. You can collect coins from the Simulator to trade with #bShadow Merchants#k.")
sm.sendSay("If you collect enough, you can even get the #bKaiserion#k, a custom Nova blade. It shares many of the traits of the legendary sword #bKaiserium#k, which Magnus now holds.")
sm.sendSay("#bKaiserion#k's blade is black. #bKaiserium#k's red hue came from Kaiser's solar connection. The replica does not have the same power, so it's simply not as strong.")
sm.sendSayOkay("Just keep your cool in the simulator. It's not Magnus, but you can learn to fight him if you pay attention. Use the portal on the right when you're ready.")
