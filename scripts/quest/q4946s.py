sm.sendNext("The only problem is that I seem to be missing my jewelry! I can't find it anywhere! Worst of all, I had several pieces commissioned by two very famous --and very expensive-- jewelers and now every piece is gone! My prized #b#t4031769#s#k and #b#t4031770#s#k have vanished! There is no way I'm showing up to a ball without the right accoutrements! That would simply be embarrassing!")
sm.sendSay("Where could they be? I used to catch Sophilia playing with my jewelry, and spanked the brat more than a few times for it. But now that she's... passed, I certainly can't blame her, can I? I'd blame the help, but as most of them have deserted, well... why, I don't know who to blame! But it must be around here somewhere! So, could you be a sweetheart and find my jewelry?")
sm.sendSayOkay("If you do this, I'll be sure to put in a good word for you to Edmunds when he hires more help! I am pretty sure I had at least #b20 #t4031769#s#k and #b10 #t4031770#s#k. Bring them to me, and I'll even give you something I found in return...")
