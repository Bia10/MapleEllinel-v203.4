sm.sendNext("Thank you so much. I knew you would say yes. As you can see, I am not from the tribes here. According to the elders here, years ago they found me lost in the streets, all bruised up and messy.")
sm.sendSay("The elders saved me, and I have been living here ever since. Unfortunately, I don't remember anything from the past. Something may have happened back then.")
sm.sendSayOkay("Maybe that's because I went through something so horrible that I had to block it all out. I guess that's why I'm so scared of the Stumps. Please, can you do me a favor and eliminate #b15 Stumps#k?")
