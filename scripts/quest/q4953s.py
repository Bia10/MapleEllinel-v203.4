sm.sendSayOkay("#b30 Locks of Doll's Hair#k should do the trick. Hmm... but where? Perhaps Edmunds may know where to find more. Or maybe you can get some back from my older models! Yes, yes, it's worth the sacrifice. Oh, and I'll also need some candy. Why, you ask? Tsk, tsk, that's the Prendergast secret, and part of the magic of my toymaking! Bring me #b10 Heartstoppers#k, #b10 Maple Candies#k, and #b10 Pumpkin Taffies#k. Doll's hair and candy. Run along now. Time's a wastin'!")
