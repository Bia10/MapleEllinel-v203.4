sm.sendNext(" Thank you so much. You'll find a water mill somewhere in this Folk Town. Go there, and you'll find #bGrandma Yeon#k. She is known for selling her pots only to her closest and dearest. I'm not sure if she'll make one for a stranger like you, but... please help me get the #bnew pot#k. Thank you.")
sm.sendSayOkay("From what I've heard, Grandma Yeon has been wondering how her husband is currently doing. He's been out fishing all day, and I have a feeling that if you keep her up to date on his whereabouts, then she may indeed give you a new pot.")
