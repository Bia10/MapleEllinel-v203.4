sm.sendNext("I knew I could talk to you. Thanks for making some time for us. I have a small, discreet favor to ask you, so please listen carefully. You've met those people at the Omega Sector, right? Are you... aware of exactly what they REALLY do, though?")
sm.sendSay("They probably told you they're here to take down the aliens, but in truth... it's NOT US that's a threat to the society; it's THEM. They are mercilessly attacking us, when the only crime we've committed is to try to coexist with the humans here.")
sm.sendSay("Their real ambition is to win the public by declaring war on the strange-looking aliens, then just when the public is at their side, they take over the world. Isn't that sickening? Every one of you is falling for it. That's why... I want you to do something to help us fight against them.")
sm.sendSayOkay("Go to the #bOmega Sector Silo#k first.\nGo investigate the boxes that look like #i3800257# there and collect 3 of #b#t4031116##k. It'll most likely contain Omega Sector's top secrets so we really need to get our hands on it. I'll be waiting here until you return.")
