sm.sendNext("It's nothing big. The thing is, hunting grounds for Level 50 - 70 Knights of Virtue are really far away. This gift for them allows them to travel more easily. ")
sm.sendSayOkay("If you use the #bTeleport Rock of Virtue#k that I gave you, it will show you the list of hunting grounds for Levels 50 - 70. Check the level of the monsters first, and then move to the area by clicking it. Using #bVirtue's Blessing#k wisely can allow you to take on higher-level monsters than you normally can. Give it a try.")
