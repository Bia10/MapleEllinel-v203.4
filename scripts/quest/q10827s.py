sm.sendNext("I am trying to start a new business... Hey! Listen carefully, this is important information.")
sm.sendSay("(Do you know Edelstein? What once used to be a civilization established by ores known as #bRue#k, has now become the territory of the #bBlack Wings#k. I used to trade in that city, but business has been rough since the Black Wings have taken over.)")
sm.sendSay("(They make us pay a ridiculous amount of taxes... They take whatever they want from us... I have suffered so much because of them! Once, I forgot to pay the protection fees, and the Black Wings took all of my treasures from my Storage Room!)")
sm.sendSay("(Hmm...I lost control there for a second... Anyway... I've decided to support the #bResistance#k for the people of Edelstein who are being suppressed. Not only because of my business, but because I have a sense of justice, too.)")
sm.sendSayOkay("Sorry, long story... In any event, I would like you to assist my Resistance support business. It's not a hard task. All you have to do is listen to what I tell you to do. We should first write up a contract. Wait a minute, let me get ready.")
