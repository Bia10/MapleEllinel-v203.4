sm.sendSayOkay("The Mushmom probably took the Gold Watch. It likes shiny stuff...I heard it has a whole nest of loose change and tin foil. You'll find Mushmom on the Mushmom Forest Trail, right from the Humming Forest Trail. Get the Gold Watch back, and then drop it in the Mailbox in front of my house. The mailman will come and pick it up tomorrow.")
