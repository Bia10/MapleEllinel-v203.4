sm.sendNext("#o3220001#is an ancient #o2100104# that evolved into a monster. He's very smart. He can even use magic! That explains why some people worship him as the guardian of the desert. It sounds foolish, I know, but a good number of people actually believe that. ")
sm.sendSay("We can't just go out and defeat #o3220001#, as that will turn many people against the Sand Bandits. We must first convince the people... Will you take on this task?")
sm.sendSay("The spokesman for the people who believe #o3220001# is the guardian of the desert is #b#p2100001##k. He is as stiff and stubborn as #t4011008#. #bConvincing#k that old man will be our first battle, before we even hunt the monster.")
sm.sendSayOkay("Convincing him won't be easy. You might have to give him a #bLidium#k as a gift before you can get him to listen... Often, when you talk to someone that stubborn, it helps to #bbeat around the bush and change the subject to get him where you want him, then put your foot down and convince him when the time is right.#k")
