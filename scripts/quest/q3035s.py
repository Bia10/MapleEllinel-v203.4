sm.sendNext("Thank you so much. After studying and researching for endless hours, I have finally found a clue that can help me seal #b#t4031056##k up for good.

sm.sendSayOkay("To prevent evil use of this book, we will require a Star Rock. Unfortunately, they are very rare. Only certain exceptionally evil beasts possess them. Please bring me #b1 #t4021009##k from a monster like Eliza, the Snow Witch, or Snowman.")
