sm.sendNext("...Really? You're going to do it? I wasn't really expecting you to say yes, but... this is great. Then... I suggest you make your way to #b#m261020700# of Alcadno#k. At this time, there should be no one inside the lab, and the lights should be out. You need to carefully get there through portals, okay? Once you get there, you'll need to search through the dark lab until you find the #bSecret Document#k.")
sm.sendSayOkay("If you bring the document, then I'll give you some information on #bThat Incident#k. People seem to want to keep it a hush hush, but... since you're in Magatia, as a proud member of Zenumist... I think you have the right to know what happened.")
