sm.sendNext("#r#p9010012##k has been constantly surveying the world of Maple, looking for ways to create chaos. Lately, he's been looking for the leaves that will help him transform into a human being. It's obvious he wants to do it so he can take advantage of some unsuspecting Maplers!")
sm.sendSay("In order to stop him from doing just that, we'll need to make him sniff #b10 #t4031584#s#k instead. Those leaves will prevent him from turning into a human being. The problem is, despicable characters like him are always suspicious of others, because they know firsthand that deception is everything, which means, it's up to you to convince him that #t4031584# is actually the leaf of transformation, okay?")
sm.sendSayOkay("Since he's looking to cause trouble in towns, I am 100% confident that he's somewhere near #m200000000#. You'll need to spot a suspicious-looking #p9010012# and hand him #t4031584#. These leaves are easily found, since most monsters carry it with them, but it's only good for one hour, so if you can help me again afterwards, please come back after one hour.")
