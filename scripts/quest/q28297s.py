sm.sendSayOkay("Very well. Let's start with the bad news. There is a monster, a ghost that is lurking around in some corner of this house. You will either be a conqueror or victim, and God forbid you end up the latter. The good news is that if you defeat this ghost and collect 20 Olivia's Dolls, you shall receive a chair as a reward. That's right, a chair. What a thing worth risking your life for, no? Oh, and by the way, it is imperative that you join a party to assist you in your adventure. You certainly won't make it back alive any other way. Go on now, brave fighter!")
